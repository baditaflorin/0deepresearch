## **I. Executive Profile: Shauna Arnott**

### **A. Current Role and Primary Focus**

Shauna Arnott is a Canadian entrepreneur, event producer, and business development consultant who has established herself as a significant figure in the creation of high-impact, curated events for the North American technology and entrepreneurship sectors. She is the Founder and CEO of Mobi Events, a boutique event management firm specializing in bespoke experiences for technology executives, founders, and investors.1 Through her various ventures, Arnott has demonstrated a distinct capability for convening influential leaders and fostering environments designed to accelerate business growth and strategic collaboration.

### **B. Core Competency: The Architect of "Curated Proximity"**

An analysis of Arnott's business model reveals that her primary offering extends beyond traditional event logistics. Her core competency lies in the strategic curation of influential networks. The marketing language for her flagship "Mission Driven" summit, "Curated Proximity \= Accelerated Possibility," encapsulates her value proposition.3 Arnott's business is not merely planning conferences; it is architecting exclusive, high-stakes environments where personal interaction among vetted leaders is the principal product. This approach aims to transform standard networking into what her company terms "NetWorthing," where conversations are engineered to be catalysts for tangible growth and high-value opportunities.3

### **C. Key Ventures and Brands**

Arnott's professional activities are channeled through two primary brands, each targeting a specific segment of the entrepreneurial ecosystem:

* **Mobi Events:** This is her core corporate entity, founded in 2015\. Mobi Events is explicitly focused on serving the technology community by creating and managing tailored think tanks, networking events, technical meetups, and industry-specific conferences for engineers, developers, founders, and executives.1  
* **Haste and Hustle:** Launched in 2016, Haste and Hustle began as an entrepreneurship conference and has since evolved into an internationally recognized media and events brand. It serves as Arnott's platform for supporting the broader startup community and has expanded into a community-driven incubator.4

### **D. Thesis Statement**

This report posits that Shauna Arnott has strategically evolved from a general corporate event planner into a high-end "network convenor." Her business model is predicated on building and monetizing access to a curated ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, and global thought leaders. Her career trajectory demonstrates a deliberate and successful progression from broad-service offerings toward higher-value, niche-focused ventures. This evolution has culminated in a significant strategic pivot from service provision to venture incubation, positioning her to capitalize directly on the success of the communities she cultivates.

## **II. Career Trajectory and Entrepreneurial Evolution**

### **A. Early Career and Educational Pivot**

Shauna Arnott's path to becoming a prominent event producer was unconventional. Her early professional life was spent in the resource development and energy sector, a male-dominated industry that she credits with teaching her strategies to overcome career barriers.2 This background provided her with a unique perspective that she later leveraged in her entrepreneurial and public speaking endeavors.

Recognizing a need for a career change, Arnott made a deliberate pivot by returning to post-secondary education. In 2008, she obtained a Master of Science (MSc) from Laurentian University.6 This was followed by more targeted business and leadership training, including a Certificate of Event Management from Niagara College in 2011 and a Certificate of Community Leadership from Leadership Niagara.6 This sequence of educational pursuits demonstrates a conscious and strategic decision to retool her skill set and move into the business and events world.

### **B. The Genesis of an Entrepreneur (2014-2016)**

Arnott's entrepreneurial journey began in earnest in the mid-2010s with the launch of several ventures in quick succession. The timeline of these launches reveals a clear and rapid strategic refinement.

* **Leverage Events (2014):** In 2014, Arnott founded her first corporate event management company, Leverage Events.4 This firm served a general corporate clientele in both Canada and the United States, planning a variety of events globally. This initial venture represented her formal entry into the event management industry with a broad, relatively undifferentiated service offering.  
* **Mobi Events (2015):** Just a year later, in 2015, she founded Mobi Events.1 This entity appears to be an evolution or strategic rebranding of her primary business. Mobi Events was launched with a much sharper focus: to serve the specific needs of the technology community. The company reportedly started with a single client in Atlanta and quickly grew its roster to include tech companies, wealth management firms, and high-profile individuals.2  
* **Haste and Hustle (2016):** In 2016, Arnott took a crucial step from being a service provider to a brand owner by launching Haste and Hustle.4 Initially a large entrepreneurship conference, this venture marked her move into the role of event producer for her own intellectual property. Haste and Hustle was designed with the explicit mission "to serve and support the startup community," allowing her to build and own a community directly.4

This progression from 2014 to 2016 is not merely a series of name changes but a clear pattern of strategic evolution. Arnott began with a generalist company (Leverage Events), quickly identified a high-value niche and repositioned her core service business to capture it (Mobi Events for tech), and simultaneously built a proprietary brand (Haste and Hustle) to cultivate an audience and community she could own. This transition from a client-service model to a brand-and-community ownership model is a classic and effective entrepreneurial growth strategy.

### **C. Personal Life and Motivations**

Publicly available information provides some context for Arnott's professional drive and personal life. She is frequently described as the mother of a son who is a semi-pro hockey player, recently signing with the Israel Elite Hockey League.2 Her dedication is highlighted by notes that she spends much of her "free' time in hockey and lacrosse arenas," a detail that appears in multiple professional biographies, suggesting it is a significant part of her identity.2

In a 2019 podcast appearance, a more grounded motivation for her intense work ethic was revealed. The host noted that Arnott's "Haste and Hustle is so one day she may afford a down payment on an investment property".7 This relatable ambition provides a compelling counterpoint to her work with globally recognized CEOs and celebrities, suggesting a practical and personal drive behind her high-flying professional life.

## **III. Analysis of Core Business Ventures**

### **A. Mobi Events: Curating High-Impact Experiences for the Tech Elite**

Mobi Events stands as Shauna Arnott's primary corporate vehicle for high-end event management and consulting. Its market position is clearly defined by its exclusive focus on the technology sector.

* **Mission and Target Audience:** The company's stated mission is to "connect tech professionals, foster innovation, and create platforms where ideas become realities".1 Its services are not for a general business audience but are explicitly tailored for "engineers, developers, tech founders, architects, and tech industry executives".1 This niche focus allows the company to develop deep domain expertise and cultivate an unmatched network within the tech ecosystem.  
* **Key Offerings:** Mobi Events provides a suite of high-touch services designed for senior leaders. These are not mass-market conferences but curated gatherings, including:  
  * **Exclusive Think Tanks:** Bringing together top minds to solve pressing industry challenges.  
  * **Networking Events:** Platforms to connect with industry leaders and potential partners.  
  * **Technical Meetups:** Deep dives into the latest technologies and trends.  
  * **Industry Conferences:** Showcasing cutting-edge innovations and expert speakers.  
  * **Media / Podcast Development:** A service that leverages the company's extensive network of media outlets and podcasts to secure guest bookings and partnership sales for clients.1  
* **Flagship Event \- "Mission Driven":** The "Mission Driven" leadership summit is the quintessential Mobi Events offering. It is positioned as an "exclusive," "invitation-only" retreat for a "deeply vetted" community of leaders.3 The event, scheduled for June 2025 in Park City, Utah, exemplifies the company's high-end strategy. The pricing structure, with packages at $7,500 and $12,000, confirms its status as a premium offering for an elite clientele seeking a significant return on investment.3 The agenda reinforces this positioning, featuring a special appearance by Sir Richard Branson and breakout sessions on frontier topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), blockchain, Web3, and the global economic impact of tariffs.3

### **B. Haste and Hustle: From Conference to Community-Driven Media Brand**

While Mobi Events serves a corporate clientele, Haste and Hustle is Arnott's proprietary brand, built to engage the broader entrepreneurial community directly.

* **Origins and Growth:** What began in 2016 as a single, large entrepreneurship conference in Toronto has successfully scaled into an "internationally recognized media and events company".4 The brand's identity is centered on providing entrepreneurs with access to resources and inspiration, with a "sincere message about entrepreneurship".2  
* **High-Profile Success:** The brand's international recognition was significantly accelerated by its ability to attract world-class speakers. Featuring marketing mogul Gary Vaynerchuk, who spoke to an audience of 3,000 in Toronto, was a pivotal moment that cemented Haste and Hustle's reputation.7 The brand has also secured or planned events with other major figures like Sir Richard Branson and Alex Mashinsky, further validating its standing in the market.5  
* **Strategic Evolution \- The Haste and Hustle Incubator:** The most significant development in the Haste and Hustle brand is its evolution beyond events and media into venture creation. Arnott is a co-founder of the "Haste and Hustle Incubator," which is "powered by Project 10K".5 This strategic partnership moves the brand up the value chain from simply inspiring entrepreneurs to actively investing in them. This incubator aims to encourage tech entrepreneurship, leveraging the Haste and Hustle community as a source of deal flow and talent.5

### **C. Brand Clarification and Market Positioning**

A thorough analysis requires differentiating Shauna Arnott's ventures from other similarly named entities in the market to avoid misattribution and accurately assess her strategic position.

* **Distinction from EventMobi:** There is significant potential for brand confusion between Arnott's **Mobi Events** (mobi-events.com) and **EventMobi** (eventmobi.com). EventMobi is a large, well-established event management *software* company founded in 2010\. It provides a technology platform offering a suite of tools like mobile event apps, virtual event platforms, badge printing, and analytics.12 In contrast, Arnott's Mobi Events is a high-touch event  
  *management and consulting service* that designs and executes bespoke events. One is a technology provider for event planners; the other is a strategic partner in event creation. The choice of the name "Mobi Events" presents a potential strategic liability. The phonetic and thematic similarity to a larger, more established player in the same industry could dilute her brand's search engine optimization (SEO) performance, confuse potential clients searching for event services, and necessitate a higher marketing spend to establish a distinct identity. The use of the hyphenated domain mobi-events.com suggests the more desirable mobievents.com was likely unavailable, further highlighting this challenge.1  
* **Other Unrelated "MOBI" Entities:** Research also identified several other entities with similar names that are definitively not associated with Shauna Arnott. These include:  
  * **MOBI NYC:** A series of social connectivity events for gay and queer people of color, with its own MOBIfest and MOBItalks programming (mobi-nyc.com).14  
  * **Mobilize:** A platform for organizing volunteer opportunities and political events (mobilize.us).15  
  * **San Francisco Bay Ferry:** This transit service uses the term "Mobi" in the context of mobile ticketing but is entirely unrelated to the events industry.16

These distinctions are critical for an accurate assessment of Arnott's market position and brand strategy.

## **IV. The Arnott Network: A Comprehensive Map of Public Associates and Collaborators**

### **A. Network as the Core Business Model**

Shauna Arnott's professional success is inextricably linked to the breadth and quality of her personal and professional network. This network is not a mere byproduct of her business activities; it is the core asset that she strategically develops, curates, and monetizes. Her ability to attract, convene, and connect influential individuals is the fundamental driver of her business model. The value of a ticket to a Mobi Events summit or a Haste and Hustle conference is less about the content of the speeches and more about the access to the other people in the room—an ecosystem meticulously assembled by Arnott herself.

### **B. Table of Publicly Documented Connections**

The following table provides a comprehensive, structured overview of Shauna Arnott's publicly documented network, segmented by the nature of the relationship.

### **C. Detailed Network Segmentation and Analysis**

The data reveals a multi-layered network that Arnott leverages for different strategic purposes.

* **1\. High-Profile Engagements (The Marquee Names):** This tier of her network consists of globally recognized figures like Sir Richard Branson and Gary Vaynerchuk.3 These are not necessarily close personal collaborators but are critical for brand validation. Securing them as speakers lends immense credibility to her Haste and Hustle and Mobi Events brands, acting as a powerful magnet for attracting high-paying attendees and significant media attention. Mentions of planning events with figures like the Duchess of York and Macklemore, even if anecdotal, serve to bolster this persona of a producer who operates at the highest levels of business and celebrity.7  
* **2\. Strategic Business Alliances (The Venture Builders):** This segment includes partners who are integral to the expansion of her business model. The most significant of these is Jared Yellin of Project 10K.5 This partnership is not merely for a single event; it represents a fundamental shift in her business, providing the framework for the Haste and Hustle Incubator and her entry into venture capital. Another key alliance is with Erwin Szeto, who acted as both a client (hiring her for his conference) and a media collaborator (hosting her on his podcast), demonstrating a symbiotic relationship that provides both revenue and public exposure.7  
* **3\. Event Collaborators and Speakers (The Ecosystem):** This is the broadest layer of her network, comprising the dozens of entrepreneurs, investors, and subject-matter experts who speak at and attend her events.3 This ecosystem is the lifeblood of her events. The extensive list of speakers for the "Mission Driven" summit, for example, showcases her deep connections within the tech, venture, and innovation communities. This network is self-reinforcing: the quality of the speakers attracts high-quality attendees, which in turn makes it easier to attract future high-quality speakers.  
* **4\. Corporate, Community, and Spiritual Affiliations (The Foundation):** This segment provides insight into her operational capacity and personal values. Her internal Mobi Events team, including key personnel like Devon Codrington (who also co-hosts her podcast), forms the execution backbone of her ventures.1 Her extensive history of volunteer roles with arts and community organizations like The Niagara Jazz Festival and The Niagara Symphony Orchestra points to a long-standing commitment to community engagement.4 Most uniquely, her role as Office Administrator at Centennial Park Baptist Church, where she supports Pastor Chris Stefanidis, presents a striking duality in her public profile.6

This dual persona is a unique and powerful branding asset. The public record presents two distinct and, on the surface, contradictory images of Shauna Arnott: the high-powered producer managing events for global CEOs and royalty, and the local church administrator managing communications for a pastor.2 In the world of high-stakes business, where trust is a critical and often intangible currency, this juxtaposition is not a liability but a strategic advantage. Her public affiliation with a faith-based organization, combined with her long history of community volunteerism, provides a powerful, implicit signal of a strong ethical framework and integrity. For clients being asked to pay upwards of $12,000 for a retreat focused on "purpose-driven impact," this duality can make her high-flying persona seem more grounded, relatable, and trustworthy, which is a significant competitive advantage in her industry.3

* **5\. Media and Personal Connections (The Social Fabric):** This final segment offers a rare glimpse into her personal circle. The mention by Erwin Szeto of Ian Szabo, Dion Beg, and Brian Scrone as her "best friends" who are also successful real estate investors provides a humanizing element to her profile.7 It suggests that her professional interest in entrepreneurship is mirrored in her personal relationships, indicating a deep immersion in the world of investment and business.

## **V. Public Persona, Thought Leadership, and Core Messaging**

Shauna Arnott has carefully cultivated a public persona and a set of thought leadership themes that are precisely aligned with the target markets of her business ventures. Her messaging is not generic; it is a strategic tool designed to build authority and rapport with the specific communities she aims to serve.

### **A. Advocating for Women in Business**

Arnott consistently positions herself as a "female business leader with a strong voice for Technical executives and women entrepreneurs".2 This advocacy is most clearly articulated in her keynote talk titled, "GET COMFORTABLE WALKING ON BROKEN GLASS, THE CEILING IS SHARP".2 This 30-45 minute presentation focuses directly on the challenges women face when building careers in male-dominated industries. Drawing from her own experiences in the resource and energy sector, the talk promises to deliver tangible takeaways, including strategies for career advancement, mindset tools for overcoming barriers, and "meaningful insights about the truths and lies about career advancement".2 This theme of female empowerment is also reflected in her stated passion for supporting projects that promote women's rights.2

### **B. Championing the "Technical Entrepreneur"**

The second pillar of her thought leadership is designed to resonate with the core audience of Mobi Events. Her talk, "BUILDING A BUSINESS WAS MY SECOND CHOICE, NOTES FROM A TECHNICAL ENTREPRENEUR," is a narrative of her own unconventional journey from a technical background into the world of entrepreneurship.2 This speech is strategically crafted to connect with an audience of engineers, developers, and tech founders. It validates their unique perspective, highlighting how technical expertise can be a powerful asset in business and innovation, while also acknowledging the specific challenges they often face in leadership roles. The stated takeaways include "strategies for technical people to gain success in business leadership" and "how to leverage the power of technical expertise in business," directly addressing the pain points of her ideal client profile.2

This focus is not accidental. Her public persona and speaking topics function as a core component of her marketing and sales funnel. The talk for women in tech ("Walking on Broken Glass") builds rapport and establishes her as an advocate and a peer who understands their struggles. The talk for technically-minded founders ("Building a Business was my Second Choice") establishes her as a credible guide who has walked a similar path. By speaking directly to the identities, challenges, and aspirations of her target demographics, she effectively builds authority, engenders trust, and creates a strong, inbound pipeline for her high-ticket events and consulting services. Her personal brand is a finely tuned instrument designed to attract the very people she aims to serve.

### **C. Commitment to Social and Economic Issues**

Beyond her business-focused messaging, Arnott's public profile includes a stated passion for broader social and economic issues. She is an advocate for projects that promote diversity and inclusion for all people.2 Furthermore, she has demonstrated a specific interest in supporting indigenous communities in Canada. This is not just a talking point; it is backed by concrete action. Her company Haste and Hustle committed to donating $10 from every ticket sold for one of its major conferences to the organization Construction for Change, with the specific goal of helping to "build a medical clinic in an indigenous community in Canada".11 This initiative adds a layer of social impact to her commercial ventures and aligns with her "Mission Driven" branding.

## **VI. Synthesis and Strategic Outlook**

### **A. The Arnott Business Model Synthesized**

Shauna Arnott's career and business ventures, when analyzed collectively, reveal a sophisticated and highly effective "network-as-a-service" model. She has moved beyond the traditional confines of event planning to become a strategic convenor. Her process involves building and nurturing a high-value ecosystem of entrepreneurs, executives, and investors through her Haste and Hustle and Mobi Events brands. She then monetizes access to this curated ecosystem through premium-priced events, bespoke consulting, and, in her most recent evolution, direct venture partnerships. Her events are the physical manifestation of the network, serving as the primary product and the engine for its continued growth.

### **B. Key Strategic Strengths**

* **Mastery of Niche Marketing:** Arnott's trajectory shows a keen understanding of market dynamics. Her pivot from a generalist event planning firm to a specialist serving the lucrative and well-defined technology and entrepreneurship community was a critical strategic move that enabled her to build deep expertise and command premium pricing.  
* **Exceptional Networking Prowess:** Her demonstrated ability to attract and collaborate with global A-list figures like Sir Richard Branson and Gary Vaynerchuk is a core strength.3 This skill validates her brands on an international scale and creates a powerful draw for her events.  
* **Brand-Building Acumen:** She has successfully built Haste and Hustle from the ground up, transforming it from a single conference into a recognized media brand with a loyal community, a podcast, and now an incubator.4 This demonstrates a capacity not just to serve clients, but to create valuable intellectual property.

### **C. Potential Challenges and Vulnerabilities**

* **Brand Confusion:** As previously analyzed, the similarity of the "Mobi Events" name to the larger software company "EventMobi" presents an ongoing strategic challenge that could hinder marketing efforts and create client confusion.1  
* **Key-Person Risk:** Arnott's businesses are heavily dependent on her personal brand, network, and vision. A significant portion of the value proposition of Mobi Events and Haste and Hustle is tied directly to her involvement. This creates a potential vulnerability, as the business's success is deeply intertwined with her personal capacity and reputation.

### **D. Future Trajectory and Outlook**

The most critical indicator of Shauna Arnott's future direction is her recent and decisive move into venture capital. The creation of the Haste and Hustle Incubator, in partnership with Jared Yellin's Project 10K, represents the strategic culmination of her entire career evolution.5 This is not simply another project; it is a fundamental shift in her business model.

This progression can be viewed as a deliberate climb up the value chain. She began as a service provider (Leverage Events), evolved into a niche specialist and brand owner (Mobi Events and Haste and Hustle), and is now becoming an equity partner. Her events are no longer just the end product; they are being transformed into a proprietary deal-flow engine for a venture incubator. This model is highly synergistic: the Haste and Hustle brand acts as the top of the funnel, attracting ambitious entrepreneurs from across North America. The community and events serve as a platform to vet their potential, and the incubator provides the vehicle to invest in the most promising among them.

This strategic capstone transforms her network from a primarily social and marketing asset into a direct financial one. It positions her to scale her influence and wealth exponentially, moving from earning fees for organizing events for entrepreneurs to owning a piece of their future success. This completes her evolution from an event planner to a key player and capital allocator within the startup economy.
