# **The "Uncommon" Canvas: Charting the Emergence and Evolution of Nefiresc Bucuresti**

**I. Introduction: The "Unconventional" Emergence of Nefiresc in Bucharest**

In the urban theatre of Bucharest, particularly during the mid-2000s and again in the mid-2010s—periods marked by an evolving civic consciousness in Romania—a distinctive initiative known as "Nefiresc," or "Grupul Nefiresc," began to sketch its presence.1 The group distinguished itself through a series of unconventional, often playful, and surprising public interventions that momentarily reconfigured the city's daily rhythms. The very name, "Nefiresc," translating from Romanian to "unnatural," "unconventional," or "uncommon," was not merely a label but a declaration of intent. This choice in branding signaled a deliberate mission to disrupt normalcy and provoke societal reflection by challenging established expectations from its inception. It was a foundational element of its identity, shaping its choice of events and its public persona.

At the heart of Nefiresc's methodology was "artivism," a blend of art and activism, where creative expression becomes a tool for social commentary and engagement. Nefiresc's activities, ranging from flashmobs to community gatherings, consistently aligned with this approach, aiming to provoke thought, foster human connection, and challenge societal norms through imaginative and often participatory means.2 The emergence of such artivist groups in Bucharest during these periods may well reflect a broader societal yearning for new avenues of expression and civic participation. This could be interpreted as a response to perceived political or social inertia, or perhaps a collective search for community and positive engagement in a rapidly changing urban landscape, offering an alternative to conventional political discourse by using novelty to capture attention.

Central to the Bucharest chapter of Nefiresc was Florin Badița, whose vision and drive were instrumental in shaping the group's activities and ethos.2 This report will provide an in-depth investigation into Nefiresc Bucuresti, chronicling its diverse activities, exploring the motivations of its founder, analyzing its reception within the city, and situating its unique approach within the broader tapestry of Romanian civic activism.

**II. The Architect of the Unconventional: Florin Badița and the Genesis of Nefiresc Bucuresti**

The primary architect and driving force behind Nefiresc's Bucharest interventions was Florin Badița.2 His vision for the initiative was rooted in a desire to cultivate a different kind of civic engagement, one that was both playful and profound.

Florin Badița's Vision

Badița articulated a clear set of motivations for Nefiresc. He sought to connect with "open-minded, always curious, always ready to try something new" individuals.2 A core objective was to dismantle social silos, creating spaces where people of different ages and mentalities could interact, thereby breaking the pattern he observed of individuals remaining confined within their established social circles.2 This desire to bridge social divides suggests an implicit critique of social fragmentation and an aim to build broader, more diverse community bonds, which are often crucial for the spread of new ideas and the fostering of collective action.

Beyond social connection, Badița aimed to instill a proactive mindset. He envisioned participants as "persons that question everything, and when they want something, instead of saying: « too bad we don't have this in Romania », to think: « How cool, I could do this here! »".2 This philosophy underscored a belief in individual agency and the potential for grassroots change. His preference for being an active organizer, rather than a passive spectator, was evident in his approach to events like the "No Pants Subway Ride," where he took the lead in bringing the idea to fruition in Bucharest.4

Dual Phases of Nefiresc Bucuresti

The trajectory of Nefiresc Bucuresti under Badița's guidance appears to have unfolded in two distinct phases. An initial period of activity is noted around 2007 in Bucharest, which was subsequently paused.2 Information regarding the specifics of this early phase is limited in the available records. The persistence of the idea, despite a hiatus, suggests it held significant personal importance for Badița, perhaps awaiting a more opportune moment or the necessary personal capacity to fully realize its potential.

The initiative experienced a more visible and documented resurgence in early 2015.2 This relaunch coincided with a period of growing civic tech engagement and heightened youth activism in Romania. Badița's professional background as a "Map Analyst" at the time 2, and later as a "data-scientist" 5, may have equipped him with skills conducive to organizing and mobilizing people in this evolving environment. This later period, due to the greater availability of data, forms the primary focus of this report.

Strategic Approach

Nefiresc's strategy, as articulated by Badița, was to employ "fun and diverse activities" as an initial point of engagement.2 The underlying goal was then to gently steer participants towards a greater awareness of "the social issues that are happening right now around them, and that they can be part of the solution".2 This approach can be understood as a form of "Trojan Horse" activism. By making civic participation appear less daunting and more enjoyable, Nefiresc aimed to lower the barriers to entry, potentially attracting individuals who might not engage with more traditional or confrontational forms of activism. Once these individuals were engaged and felt part of a community, they might become more receptive to discussions about deeper social issues. This represents a strategic pathway from playful participation to heightened civic consciousness.

**III. Nefiresc in Action: A Chronicle of Bucharest Interventions**

Nefiresc Bucuresti's engagement with the city manifested through a variety of public interventions, evolving in nature from early 2015 to later activities in 2019. These actions consistently centered on the re-imagination and reclamation of public space as a venue for play, connection, and civic expression. The following table provides an overview of key events:

**A. Flashmobs and Public Space Appropriations (Primarily 2015)**

The early months of 2015 saw Nefiresc Bucuresti orchestrate a series of high-visibility flashmobs, often adapting international trends for the local context. These events were characterized by their surprise element and their temporary disruption of everyday urban life.

The **"No Pants Subway Ride"** (or "Ziua Fără Pantaloni la Metrou") on January 11, 2015, involved participants riding the Bucharest Metro without trousers, aiming to amuse and startle fellow commuters.3 Organized by Florin Badița and Grupul Nefiresc, this event was part of a global phenomenon, which Badița mentioned he had been waiting two years to organize in Bucharest.4 The intervention generated considerable media attention and, as will be discussed later, some public complaints and official disapproval.4

Following this, on February 1, 2015, Nefiresc staged **"Frozen Bucharest"**.3 Approximately 200 individuals participated by simultaneously "freezing" in a predetermined but publicly undisclosed metro station for five minutes. The stated aim was to make onlookers "see the world differently" and "smile," bringing a moment of unexpected stillness and creativity to what Badița described as crowded and "gloomy" areas of the city.3

Later that month, on February 28, 2015, Grupul Nefiresc organized a **"Free Hugs"** event in downtown Bucharest's Universitate Square.1 Inspired by the international movement promoting human connection, participants offered free hugs to passersby. The initiative aimed to combat social disconnectivity and was envisioned as a recurring event.1 These early 2015 activities clearly demonstrate a tactic of using surprise and playful disruption to capture public attention and momentarily alter the urban experience.

**B. Community Building and Dialogue (Primarily 2019)**

By 2019, Nefiresc's activities in Bucharest appeared to shift towards fostering more sustained community engagement. This was evident in two large-scale picnics organized in Cișmigiu Park. The first, a **"Picnic Nefiresc in toiul nopții"** (Nocturnal Unconventional Picnic), took place on August 13, 2019, reportedly drawing around 1,000 people for an evening of music, shared food, and camaraderie.8 This event was co-organized with GOKID!, an online platform for family events.9

A subsequent daytime picnic followed on September 14, 2019, also in Cișmigiu Park.8 Both picnics featured a reading corner hosted by **Casa Activistului** (The Activist House), which provided books from its civic library.8 This collaboration is noteworthy as it linked Nefiresc's accessible, community-oriented events with a more established hub for civic resources and activism.

The September picnic also marked the Bucharest premiere of **"Invisible Conversations"**.8 This activity involved participants engaging in conversations with strangers while blindfolded, an approach designed to foster deeper, unbiased connections by removing visual preconceptions. The 2019 picnics, with their emphasis on shared experience and dialogue, represent a move from the fleeting impact of flashmobs to initiatives aimed at building more lasting social bonds.

**C. Ambitious Urban Projects and Planned Initiatives (Announced 2015)**

Alongside its direct interventions, Nefiresc, under Florin Badița's leadership, also announced more ambitious projects aimed at creating lasting changes to Bucharest's urban environment in early 2015.

The most detailed of these was **"Leagane pentru adulti"** (Swings for Adults), with a planned launch for March 1, 2015.7 This initiative sought to install swings specifically designed for adults in Bucharest's parks, starting with an initial two swings.10 The project was inspired by similar installations in Montreal, Canada, and Craiova, Romania, and was contingent on procedural approvals from ALPAB (Administrația Lacuri, Parcuri și Agrement București – The Administration of Lakes, Parks and Recreation Bucharest).7 Nefiresc also welcomed sponsorships for this endeavor, signaling an ambition for more permanent urban installations and a willingness to engage with city authorities, a notable departure from the unsanctioned nature of some earlier flashmobs.

As of February 2015, Grupul Nefiresc also publicized a pipeline of other creative events they were preparing. These included **"X si 0 la metrou"** (Tic-Tac-Toe at the metro), a **"Jam Session"** in Parcul Izvor, and an event titled **"Turnul Parasutistilor"** (Parachutists' Tower).3 While these plans demonstrated a continued flow of inventive ideas, the available information does not confirm their subsequent execution.

The evolution of Nefiresc Bucuresti's tactics, from disruptive flashmobs to community-focused gatherings and planned permanent installations, suggests a dynamic approach to civic engagement. A consistent thread across these varied activities was the re-imagination of public spaces—metro stations, parks, city squares—transforming them from sites of mere transit or passive observation into arenas for play, connection, and civic expression. Furthermore, the adaptation of international trends like the "No Pants Subway Ride," "Free Hugs," and the concept for adult swings indicates an awareness of global civic innovation, with these models being localized for the Bucharest context.

**IV. Echoes in the City: Public and Media Reception of Nefiresc's Activities**

The unconventional interventions of Nefiresc Bucuresti naturally elicited a spectrum of reactions from the public, media, and official bodies. These responses shed light on the challenges and perceptions surrounding such forms of artivism in an urban setting.

Media Coverage

Nefiresc's events, particularly those in early 2015, were picked up by a range of Romanian media outlets. Publications such as Romania Insider 1, Mediafax 3, and Hotnews.ro 6 provided largely factual accounts of the flashmobs and planned initiatives. Platforms like Gokid.ro later covered the 2019 picnics, focusing on their community and family-friendly aspects.8 The tone of coverage was not uniform; while some outlets reported straightforwardly, others, like the blog Piticigratis.com, offered highly critical and satirical commentary on events like the "No Pants Subway Ride".4 This demonstrates that the media acted as both an amplifier for Nefiresc's activities, granting them a broader audience, and as a forum for diverse, sometimes conflicting, interpretations of their actions and underlying intentions. Once these events entered the public domain through media channels, Nefiresc could not fully control the narrative surrounding them.

Public Reactions

Nefiresc's stated aim for many of its actions was to evoke positive emotions: to make people "smile," "see the world differently," and feel "happy".3 The significant turnout for the 2019 Cișmigiu picnic, with an estimated 1,000 attendees at the August event 8, suggests a positive reception and an appetite for such community gatherings among a segment of Bucharest's population.

However, the more disruptive early events also provoked negative responses. The "No Pants Subway Ride" notably drew complaints from some commuters who found the act "disruptive and indecent," questioning its legality and morality.4 The aforementioned Piticigratis.com article was particularly scathing, dismissing participants as "hipsteri șomeri" (unemployed hipsters) and "idioți" engaging in attention-seeking behavior.4 This mixed public reception highlights an inherent tension in Nefiresc's "unconventional" methodology. While striving for positive engagement, the deliberate disruption of established norms inevitably risked alienating or offending portions of the public, particularly with unsanctioned events.

Official Reactions

Official bodies also responded to Nefiresc's activities. In the case of the "No Pants Subway Ride," Metrorex, the Bucharest Metro authority, publicly stated that it had not given its accord for the event and warned that "indecent travelers" would be fined.3 This official stance underscored the friction between Nefiresc's guerrilla-style interventions and regulatory frameworks.

Conversely, the "Leagane pentru adulti" (Swings for Adults) project represented a different mode of engagement with authorities. Its planned implementation was explicitly contingent on navigating procedures with ALPAB (The Administration of Lakes, Parks and Recreation Bucharest).7 This indicated a recognition that certain types of civic improvements or permanent installations necessitate collaboration with, or at least permission from, city institutions. This approach suggests a potential maturation in strategy or a diversification of tactics, acknowledging that some projects require working within official channels, contrasting with the more confrontational or unsanctioned style of earlier flashmobs.

**V. The Nefiresc Entities: Civic Initiative vs. Commercial Enterprise (Nefiresc People SRL)**

A crucial point of clarification in the research of "Nefiresc Bucuresti" involves distinguishing between the civic initiative led by Florin Badița and a later registered commercial entity bearing a similar name.

Grupul Nefiresc / Nefiresc (Civic Initiative)

This is the entity primarily associated with the artivism, flashmobs, and community events that are the main focus of this report. Active in Bucharest with an initial phase around 2007 and a more prominent period between 2015 and 2019, this initiative was spearheaded by Florin Badița.1 Badița himself referred to Nefiresc as an "on-going NGO" in a 2015 interview 2, though specific formal registration details for this civic group during that exact period are not explicitly detailed in the available records. Its activities were characterized by public interventions and community building.

NEFIRESC PEOPLE SRL (Commercial Company)

In contrast, NEFIRESC PEOPLE SRL is a limited liability company registered with Romanian authorities in 2021.11 Its main declared activity falls under CAEN code 6201, which pertains to "Activities of creation of software to order (customer-oriented software)".12 The company is located in Bucharest's Sector 6 and, according to financial data from 2023, operates as an active microenterprise with one employee, generating turnover and net profit, albeit with a decrease compared to the previous year.12

Clarification of Relationship

The considerable time difference between the peak activities of the civic initiative (mainly 2015-2019) and the registration of the SRL (2021), coupled with their fundamentally different natures (civic artivism versus software development), strongly suggests that NEFIRESC PEOPLE SRL is a separate entity from the original "Grupul Nefiresc." Based on the available information, a direct operational link between the software company and the earlier civic events is not evident. The similarity in name could be coincidental, an homage to the earlier initiative, or a later business venture by individuals who were once involved. However, without further data, any connection beyond the name remains speculative. The emergence of this commercial entity years after the main public activities of "Grupul Nefiresc," and in a completely unrelated field, reinforces the likelihood of their distinct identities. Addressing the user's query about "Nefiresc Bucuresti" necessitates this careful differentiation, as the primary interest appears to lie with the unconventional civic and artivist phenomenon rather than the software development company.

**VI. The Evolving Landscape of Activism: Nefiresc Bucuresti in Context**

Nefiresc Bucuresti did not exist in a vacuum. It was part of a dynamic civic landscape in Romania and a chapter in the evolving activist trajectory of its founder, Florin Badița. Understanding this broader context, particularly the impact of the Colectiv nightclub fire, is essential to appreciating Nefiresc's position.

Florin Badița's Activist Trajectory

Nefiresc can be seen as an early phase of Florin Badița's public engagement, characterized by its playful and artivist approach. However, the Colectiv nightclub fire on October 30, 2015—a national tragedy that claimed 64 lives due to corruption and regulatory failures—became a pivotal moment.13 Badița, who lost a friend in the disaster 14, was profoundly affected.

In the aftermath of Colectiv, Badița founded "Corupția Ucide" (Corruption Kills), a civic platform that adopted a more direct and confrontational approach to fighting corruption.5 This organization focused on civic education, organizing large-scale street protests, and applying sustained social pressure on governmental bodies.5 "Corupția Ucide" grew to become one of Romania's largest and most influential civic organizations, facilitating protests that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets—some reports citing figures between 500,000 and 600,000 participants.5 Badița's work with "Corupția Ucide" earned him significant recognition, including a place on Forbes' 30 under 30 Europe list in 2018 and a nomination as European Personality of the Year by Euronews in the same year for his anti-corruption efforts.5

The Colectiv tragedy appears to have acted as a powerful catalyst for Badița. It arguably transformed his primary mode of activism from the creative, community-focused interventions of Nefiresc towards the more urgent, mass-mobilizing anti-corruption work of "Corupția Ucide." The foundational goals of Nefiresc—to make people "proactive" and "conscious of social issues" 2—found a more direct and politically charged expression in the post-Colectiv environment.

Connection to Casa Activistului

A tangible link between Badița's earlier and later activism is evident in the collaboration between Nefiresc and Casa Activistului. Casa Activistului (The Activist House) was an initiative of Asociația Corupția Ucide, serving as a physical and organizational hub for various civic activities.17 Nefiresc's partnership with Casa Activistului for the 2019 Cișmigiu picnics, where the latter provided a reading corner and a presence 8, demonstrates a strategic integration of Badița's different initiatives. This suggests that the community-building methodologies and the public appeal cultivated by Nefiresc were seen as valuable assets that could support the infrastructure and network of the broader anti-corruption movement. Nefiresc could draw people in through accessible events, while Casa Activistului could offer pathways for deeper engagement and resources. Interestingly, Nefiresc Cluj is also noted as a partner with Casa Activistului for "midnight manifest picnics," indicating a broader network of these "Nefiresc" branded activities.17

Nefiresc's Place in the Spectrum of Activism

Nefiresc Bucuresti carved out a unique niche in Romania's activist spectrum. Its emphasis on artivism, playful engagement, and community building offered an alternative to more traditional forms of protest or advocacy, such as those later employed with great impact by Corupția Ucide. Nefiresc can be viewed as an incubator for Badița's early ideas on civic engagement and community mobilization. The skills, networks, and the very ethos of questioning norms and seeking creative solutions, which were central to Nefiresc, likely contributed to the capacity to organize and sustain larger, more politically focused movements later on.

**VII. Conclusion: The Legacy and Spirit of "Nefiresc" in Bucharest's Civic Tapestry**

Nefiresc Bucuresti, under the stewardship of Florin Badița, etched a distinctive mark on the civic landscape of Romania's capital. Its core characteristics—an unconventional and playful approach, a consistent focus on reimagining public space, a commitment to community building, and an underlying aim of consciousness-raising—set it apart. The initiative deliberately sought to be "uncommon," challenging norms and inviting citizens to participate in unexpected ways.

Assessing the direct, measurable impact of Nefiresc in terms of policy changes is complex, as its goals were often more focused on shifting mindsets and fostering connections. Did it achieve Badița's stated aims of cultivating proactivity and breaking down social barriers? While definitive metrics are elusive, the events demonstrably generated public dialogue, attracted media attention, and encouraged participation, as evidenced by the significant attendance at its later picnics.8 The very act of transforming mundane urban locations into sites of spontaneous joy, reflection, or interaction contributed to a re-evaluation of civic agency.

The "Nefiresc" spirit arguably contributed to diversifying the forms of civic expression available in Bucharest. It offered an alternative pathway to engagement, one that prioritized creativity and accessibility over confrontation, potentially appealing to individuals who might not have been drawn to more traditional forms of activism. This is particularly relevant in urban settings where individuals can feel disconnected or apathetic towards conventional political action. Nefiresc demonstrated that activism need not always be somber; it could also be a source of joy, connection, and shared experience, thereby broadening its potential appeal.

In Florin Badița's personal activist narrative, Nefiresc represents an important early chapter. It was a period of exploring and testing methods of engagement, of learning how to mobilize communities, and of understanding the power of unconventional approaches. These experiences and the ethos developed during the Nefiresc years may well have informed and fueled his subsequent, larger-scale work with Corupția Ucide, where the call for proactivity and social consciousness found a more urgent and politically potent voice in the wake of national tragedy.

Ultimately, the legacy of Nefiresc Bucuresti may lie less in concrete political victories and more in its contribution to a culture of civic participation and creative intervention in the city. It encouraged individuals to see and use public space differently, to question the status quo in playful yet meaningful ways, and to believe in their collective agency to create "uncommon" and memorable experiences. In this, Nefiresc underscored the value of artivism and unconventional initiatives as vital components of a vibrant and responsive urban civic life.
