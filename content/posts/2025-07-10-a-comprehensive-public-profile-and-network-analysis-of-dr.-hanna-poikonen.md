# **A Comprehensive Public Profile and Network Analysis of Dr. Hanna Poikonen**

## **Section 1: Professional Synopsis**

Dr. Hanna Liisa Poikonen, a Finnish national born on March 8, 1985, has established a distinguished and uniquely modern career at the intersection of neuroscience, the performing arts, and applied wellness.1 She operates as a multi-disciplinary researcher, an educator, and a scientific entrepreneur, leveraging a rigorous academic foundation to build a global brand. Her professional identity is defined by a systematic "research-to-impact" pipeline, where fundamental scientific inquiry is translated into a branded, commercialized, and globally disseminated methodology.

Her core academic credentials include a Doctor of Philosophy from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Helsinki, awarded with distinction, and significant postdoctoral training at the prestigious Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich.1 Dr. Poikonen's primary research domains are the neuroscience of expertise and embodied cognition. She employs advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly mobile electroencephalography (EEG), to study the brain functions of experts in diverse fields, including professional dancers, musicians, and mathematicians, often in naturalistic, real-world settings.2 This work seeks to deconstruct the neural underpinnings of mastery and deep concentration.

The primary vehicle for the translation of her research is the "WiseMotion" method, a signature intellectual property she founded in 2018, the same year she completed her doctorate.1 WiseMotion is explicitly marketed as a synthesis of neuroscience, creative movement, and meditation, designed to improve wellbeing by addressing issues such as stress, concentration, and emotional regulation.5 This method serves as the bridge between her academic findings and practical application, allowing her to engage a remarkably broad audience that spans educators, healthcare professionals, corporate executives, individuals with brain-related illnesses, and clients in the luxury wellness sector.2

Dr. Poikonen's career is further characterized by a significant and expanding international network. She maintains active affiliations with top-tier academic institutions in Switzerland and Sweden, collaborates within large, EU-funded research consortia, and has forged partnerships within the high-end global wellness industry.8 This strategic positioning allows her to operate simultaneously as a credible scientist, an innovative educator, and a successful entrepreneur, representing a new paradigm for the 21st-century academic who moves fluidly between the laboratory, the classroom, and the marketplace.

## **Section 2: Academic and Professional Trajectory**

Dr. Poikonen’s professional trajectory is marked by a deliberate and early pattern of interdisciplinary integration and international mobility. Her educational and career choices demonstrate a consistent strategy of "institutional bridging," positioning herself at the nexus of disparate fields, sectors, and countries. This approach has allowed her to act as a knowledge broker, drawing insights from one domain to innovate in another, which has been fundamental to her success in securing diverse funding, collaborations, and audiences.

Her academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in biomedical engineering from the Technical University of Tampere, completed in 2008\.11 This was followed by a Master of Science (MSc) from the Aalto University School of Science in 2011\. Her master's degree program was highly indicative of her future path, combining a major in neuroscience and biomedical engineering with unconventional minors in art theory and intercultural communication.1 This early fusion of hard science with the humanities and social sciences laid the intellectual groundwork for her entire career. During this period, she also proactively built an international network through two ERASMUS exchange programs at ETH Zurich, first in the Department of Electrotechnics and then in the Department of Information Technology in 2009\.1

Her doctoral studies, undertaken from 2013 to 2018 at the prestigious Faculty of Medicine of the University of Helsinki, culminated in a PhD that was "Approved with distinction," a grade awarded to only the top 10% of doctoral candidates in Finland.1 Her dissertation, titled "Dance on Cortex – ERPs and Phase Synchrony in Dancers and Musicians during a Contemporary Dance Piece," established the core of her research program on the neuroscience of expertise and naturalistic stimuli.1

Following her PhD, she secured a Postdoctoral Researcher position at ETH Zurich, working from 2019 to 2023 at the Professorship of Learning Sciences and Higher Education. There, she expanded her research on expertise from the arts to the sciences, focusing on the neural correlates of mathematical reasoning and embodied cognition.2 Her connection to ETH Zurich continues, as she is currently an academic guest at the Social Brain Sciences lab, where she is collaborating with political scientist Dr. Aydin Yildirim on the emerging field of "neuropolitics".2

Concurrently, Dr. Poikonen holds a guest researcher position at the Örebro University Hospital in Sweden, where she investigates the therapeutic potential of creative movement interventions for individuals with schizophrenia.2 This role exemplifies her cross-sectoral approach, linking a premier technical university with a clinical healthcare institution. The capstone of her professional activities is her role as Founder and Educator of the WiseMotion Community, an international platform she established in 2018 to disseminate her work through workshops, retreats, and educational programs.1

## **Section 3: Analysis of Core Research Contributions and Intellectual Property**

Dr. Hanna Poikonen's research contributions are characterized by a coherent intellectual program that follows a distinct "spiral" model: she establishes a core finding in one domain, validates and expands it in a more complex and naturalistic setting, and finally applies the generalized principle to new domains and clinical contexts. This systematic strategy has allowed her to build a robust and influential body of work that is both theoretically innovative and practically relevant.

### **3.1 The Neuroscience of Expertise: Deconstructing Mastery**

The foundation of Dr. Poikonen's research is the neuroscientific investigation of expertise. Her doctoral work was seminal in this area, utilizing EEG to compare the brain activity of professional dancers, musicians, and novices as they observed an audio-visual dance performance.2 A key finding, published in journals such as the

*European Journal of Neuroscience*, was that expert dancers exhibited significantly stronger phase synchrony in the theta frequency band (4−8 Hz) over fronto-central brain regions compared to novices.3 This enhanced synchrony is interpreted as a neural marker of expertise, reflecting the experts' ability to engage motor imagery, multisensory integration, and social perception processes more deeply and efficiently when observing actions within their domain of mastery.16 Her work suggests that years of physical and artistic training fundamentally reshape the brain's functional networks, making perception an active, embodied process.

Demonstrating the thematic continuity of her research, she later extended this framework from the arts to the sciences. In her postdoctoral work at ETH Zurich, she investigated the brain activity of mathematics experts and novices as they evaluated complex mathematical proofs.1 This research, published in journals like

*Cerebral Cortex*, revealed that math experts show enhanced large-scale delta phase synchrony (0.5−4 Hz) during these tasks.11 This finding suggests that deep, sustained concentration in a highly abstract domain also has a distinct neural signature, potentially related to the brain's ability to maintain focus and integrate complex information over long periods. By applying the same core questions and similar methodologies to both dance and mathematics, she works to uncover domain-general principles of how the brain achieves mastery.

### **3.2 Advancements in Naturalistic Research: From the Lab to the LIVELab**

A defining feature of Dr. Poikonen's work is her commitment to increasing the ecological validity of brain research. She has been a vocal proponent of moving neuroscience "from using strictly controlled stimuli towards understanding brain functioning in complex naturalistic contexts" like classrooms, theatres, and museums.3 Traditional neuroscience often relies on simplified, repetitive stimuli in isolated laboratory settings, which may not capture how the brain operates in the real world. Dr. Poikonen's work directly challenges this paradigm.

The most striking example of this approach was a study conducted at McMaster University's internationally renowned LIVELab in Canada.2 In a significant methodological leap, she recorded EEG data from an entire audience—comprising dancers, musicians, and novices—as they watched a

*live* dance duet performance.2 This experiment, a collaboration with Dr. Laurel Trainor, was one of the first of its kind and allowed for the study of brain activity in a genuine, shared, social, and artistic environment. The results, published in 2024, not only confirmed her previous findings on theta synchrony in dancers but also revealed that musicians showed stronger delta synchrony, suggesting their expertise enhances sensitivity to temporal regularities in movement and sound.3 This study provided powerful evidence that real-world interaction is unique for the brain and that expertise shapes the spectator experience in measurable ways.

She has applied this same naturalistic principle to her research in education. To study mathematical cognition, she employed mobile EEG technology to record students' brain activity as they engaged with mathematical material within a realistic tutor-student framework, rather than in isolation in front of a computer screen.3 This dedication to studying the brain "in the wild" is a significant contribution to cognitive neuroscience, pushing the field toward methods that better reflect the complexity of human experience.

### **3.3 Clinical and Therapeutic Applications: Movement as Medicine**

The final turn in Dr. Poikonen's research spiral is the translation of her foundational findings into clinical and therapeutic applications. She actively investigates how creative movement, grounded in neuroscientific principles, can be used as a form of "medicine" to support mental and physical health. Her most prominent work in this area is her ongoing research at Örebro University Hospital in Sweden, where she is developing and testing a creative movement intervention for people with schizophrenia.2 This project, titled "InMotion" and supported by significant grants from the Märta Lundqvist Foundation, aims to address symptoms that impact social functioning and self-care in a population for whom traditional treatments can be limited.1

Her therapeutic interests extend to other conditions as well. She has discussed her work with stroke survivors, using dance and movement to aid in rehabilitation and provide hope, and has also worked with patients experiencing chronic fatigue and long COVID.4 This applied work is further solidified by her role as a scientific advisor for the CHIST-ERA project "ReHaB – Rehabilitation using HMD and BCI".1 This project explores the use of advanced technologies like head-mounted displays (HMD) and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in rehabilitation, placing her at the forefront of technology-assisted therapeutic development. This body of work demonstrates a clear commitment to ensuring that her scientific insights have a tangible, positive impact on human health and wellbeing.

## **Section 4: The WiseMotion Method: A Synthesis of Science, Art, and Commerce**

The WiseMotion method, founded by Dr. Poikonen in 2018, stands as the central pillar of her public-facing identity and represents a masterful case study in academic entrepreneurship.1 It is not merely a series of workshops but a comprehensive platform that allows her to operate simultaneously and successfully in four distinct markets: academic research, professional development, corporate wellness, and luxury consumer wellness. This strategic diversification amplifies her impact, de-risks her career from reliance on traditional academic funding, and creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem where credibility in one domain enhances value in the others.

The methodology of WiseMotion is explicitly and transparently rooted in her academic work. It is described as a "remarkable blend of movement and neuroscience" that combines guided movement improvisation, scientific knowledge, and interactive discussions.4 The workshops and retreats merge practices from contemporary dance, somatic methods, and meditation with accessible lectures on neuroscience, covering topics such as brain plasticity, stress, concentration, and creativity.4 This direct link to science is its core value proposition, lending it an evidence-based credibility that distinguishes it from other wellness offerings.

The success of WiseMotion is built on its ability to be skillfully packaged and marketed to an exceptionally broad range of clients. This multi-market strategy can be broken down as follows:

1. **Academic Research Platform:** The WiseMotion Community is a formal partner in EU-funded research projects like DanceBrainRehab and DanceCARE.9 In this context, WiseMotion is positioned as a scientifically-grounded, standardized intervention protocol that can be deployed and studied in research settings. This role reinforces the method's scientific legitimacy and provides a channel for further validation.  
2. **Professional Development and Training:** Dr. Poikonen teaches the WiseMotion method to "educators, creative and healthcare professionals".2 For this audience, the offering is a form of continuing education, providing practitioners with new, evidence-based tools and frameworks to use in their own work with students, clients, and patients.  
3. **Corporate Wellness and Executive Training:** The method is also taught to "higher executives".2 In this corporate context, the benefits are framed around performance enhancement: improving focus, managing stress, fostering creativity, and enhancing leadership skills through embodied practices. This taps into the growing corporate wellness market.  
4. **Luxury Consumer Wellness:** Perhaps the most visible and commercially successful vertical is the high-end wellness market. Dr. Poikonen has established partnerships with elite global brands, offering WiseMotion as a premium, transformative experience for affluent clients. She is a visiting practitioner at luxury resorts such as Joali Being in the Maldives and Six Senses in Portugal and Spain.6 At these venues, private sessions are offered at premium prices, such as $450 for a 45-minute session or $700 for a 90-minute session.6 Furthermore, she hosts multi-day, exclusive retreats at venues like the Arctic TreeHouse Hotel in Finland, which combine her masterclasses with luxury accommodation and nature experiences.24

This sophisticated, multi-pronged strategy demonstrates a keen understanding of branding and market segmentation. The core intellectual property—the WiseMotion method—remains consistent, but its framing, marketing, and pricing are tailored to each specific audience. Success in one vertical directly benefits the others; for example, a publication in *Scientific American* 3 enhances the marketing appeal of a luxury retreat, while a partnership with Harvard Medical School 7 bolsters her credibility when pitching to corporate clients. This dynamic creates a powerful feedback loop, positioning Dr. Poikonen as a uniquely effective scientific entrepreneur.

## **Section 6: Concluding Analysis and Forward Outlook**

The career of Dr. Hanna Poikonen represents a compelling model of the modern, entrepreneurial academic. An analysis of her trajectory, research output, and public-facing activities reveals a highly strategic and effective operator who has successfully built a self-reinforcing ecosystem that spans fundamental science, clinical application, and commercial enterprise. She is a master of interdisciplinary synthesis, a methodological innovator in cognitive neuroscience, and a skilled communicator capable of translating complex science into accessible and high-value practices for a diverse global audience.

Her influence is distinctly multi-faceted. Within academia, she is at the vanguard of a movement pushing for greater ecological validity in brain research, demonstrating through her work at McMaster's LIVELab and her mobile EEG studies that it is possible to conduct rigorous neuroscience in complex, real-world settings. In the therapeutic domain, she is pioneering the development of evidence-based movement interventions for challenging conditions like schizophrenia, translating her findings on embodiment and brain plasticity into tangible clinical protocols. In the public sphere, she has become a prominent and credible voice in the wellness movement, leveraging her scientific credentials to bring a new level of rigor to discussions of mind-body connection.

Based on the patterns evident in her career to date, several future trajectories can be projected:

1. **Deepening Clinical Integration and Digital Therapeutics:** Dr. Poikonen's current work in schizophrenia rehabilitation and her advisory role in the "ReHaB" project signal a clear path toward more formalized clinical applications.1 A logical next step would be to move WiseMotion beyond a workshop-based method toward a certified digital therapeutic (DTx). This could involve developing a standardized, app-based version of her movement protocols that could be prescribed by clinicians, monitored remotely, and validated through large-scale clinical trials. This would dramatically increase the scalability and clinical impact of her work.  
2. **Expansion into New Domains of Expertise:** Her intellectual trajectory shows a pattern of applying her "neuroscience of expertise" framework to new fields—from dance and music to mathematics, and most recently, to "neuropolitics".2 This pattern is likely to continue. She may extend her research to other complex cognitive domains that are of high commercial value, such as strategic decision-making, leadership, or even elite software engineering. Success in these areas would open up new and lucrative corporate consulting and executive training opportunities, a market she has already begun to cultivate.2  
3. **Scaling the WiseMotion Platform via Certification:** Currently, the high-end delivery of WiseMotion is intrinsically linked to Dr. Poikonen herself as the primary practitioner.6 To overcome this limitation and achieve global scale, the most logical business development strategy would be to establish a "train-the-trainer" certification program. By creating a curriculum to certify other practitioners in the WiseMotion method, she could create a global network of licensed instructors. This would transform her business model from one based on direct service delivery to one based on intellectual property licensing and education, creating a more passive and highly scalable revenue stream.

In conclusion, Dr. Hanna Poikonen is a paradigmatic figure of the 21st-century researcher. She is not confined to the traditional silos of academia but actively constructs bridges between science, art, health, and commerce. By demonstrating that rigorous research can be the foundation for a thriving entrepreneurial venture, and that public engagement can in turn fuel new scientific questions, she has created a powerful, dynamic, and influential career that is likely to expand in both scope and impact in the years to come.
