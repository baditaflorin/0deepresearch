He also has a keen interest in fitness, including achieving a 1st Dan Black Belt in Seibukan Karatedo and participating in challenging obstacle course races for charity.1 His personal website, anthonygiordano.me, further outlines his perspectives on growth through marketing, data, and AI.5

### \*\***B. Education**\*\*

Giordano's academic background has provided a strong foundation for his career in marketing and business development.

\* \*\***Stuyvesant High School:**\*\* He is an alumnus of Stuyvesant High School, a specialized public high school in New York City known for its rigorous academic standards.2  

\* \*\***Villanova University:**\*\* Giordano earned a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Marketing with a minor in Cognitive Science from Villanova University, graduating with honors.2 His engagement with Villanova has continued post-graduation, where he served as an Advertising Industry Career Circle Facilitator (September 2023 \\- April 2024\\) 1, a member of the Mentor Program Advisory Board (2017-2020) 1, and a coach and judge for Villanova's briefCASE Challenge.3 This sustained involvement underscores a commitment to mentoring and contributing to his alma mater.
