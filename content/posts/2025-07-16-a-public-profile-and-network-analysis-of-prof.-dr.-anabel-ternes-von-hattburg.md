# **A Public Profile and Network Analysis of Prof. Dr. Anabel Ternes von Hattburg**

## **Section 1: Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive public profile and network analysis of Prof. Dr. Anabel Ternes von Hattburg, a prominent German academic, entrepreneur, and public intellectual. The analysis synthesizes publicly available information to construct a detailed overview of her biography, professional activities, intellectual contributions, and, most critically, her extensive network of associates and collaborators. Prof. Ternes von Hattburg has cultivated a multifaceted career at the intersection of sustainability, digitalization, technology trends, and leadership. Her public persona is built on a foundation of extensive academic credentials and high-level corporate experience, which she leverages across a diverse portfolio of roles.

The key findings of this report reveal a highly strategic and synergistic professional architecture. Prof. Ternes von Hattburg's activities in academia as the Managing Director of the SRH Institute for Innovation & Sustainable Management, her entrepreneurial ventures, her prolific output as an author and media personality, and her engagement with global think tanks like the Club of Rome and Club of Budapest are not disparate activities. Rather, they form a self-reinforcing ecosystem where each role lends credibility to and amplifies the others. This construct has enabled her to build a powerful personal brand and position herself as a central, trusted node connecting the distinct worlds of business, academia, and global advocacy.

A critical finding for any due diligence assessment is the significant ambiguity surrounding two of her most frequently cited corporate leadership roles: CEO of "Sustain Plus GmbH" and CEO of "BrightShift Media Groupe." While these titles are prominent in her professional branding, extensive analysis of public records fails to substantiate these specific German entities as significant, operational businesses under her leadership. The most prominent organizations bearing these names are demonstrably unconnected to her. This discrepancy between her public-facing titles and the available corroborating data represents a notable information vacuum and a potential reputational risk that requires careful consideration.

The report concludes with an exhaustive mapping of her network, which is extensive in both scale and strategic importance. Her affiliations span influential global policy circles, corporate boards, academic collaborations, and social impact organizations. This network is the primary vehicle for her influence and is detailed granularly in the appendices to provide a complete picture of her public connections.

## **Section 2: Biographical Overview and Foundational Profile**

### **2.1. Personal and Educational Background**

Prof. Dr. Anabel Cäcilia Ternès von Hattburg, also documented in some public records as Anabel Cäcilia Prinzessin von Preußen-Ternés von Hattburg, has constructed a public identity grounded in a robust academic foundation and formative personal experiences that align with her core professional themes of sustainability, education, and human rights.1

Her academic journey is extensive and interdisciplinary, providing the credentials that underpin her expertise across multiple fields. Her qualifications include:

* **Doctor of Philosophy (Dr. phil.):** Earned on a part-time basis between 2002 and 2004 from the University of Magdeburg's Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education. Her doctoral thesis was titled "Das ästhetische Spiel von Text, Leser und Autor" ("The Aesthetic Play of Text, Reader and Author").3  
* **Master of Arts (M.A.):** Completed between 1991 and 1994 at the Universities of Cologne and Osnabrück, with concentrations in German Studies, Catholic Theology, and History.3 Other sources also reference a Master of Arts in humanities and cultural sciences.5  
* **Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.):** She is documented as holding a Master of Business Administration, though the specific granting institution is not specified in the available materials.6  
* **Master of Education (Diplom-Pädagogin):** Obtained part-time from 2001 to 2002 at the University of Osnabrück. Her studies focused on psychology, media education, and media didactics, fields that are directly relevant to her later work in communication and digital learning.3  
* **Diploma in Business Administration (Diplom-Kauffrau):** Earned through part-time study between 1997 and 2001 from the FernUniversität in Hagen, Germany's state-funded distance-learning university.3

Her public narrative frequently highlights formative life events that serve as the origin story for her professional passions. A key element of this narrative is her early commitment to environmentalism, which she traces back to age seven, when she reportedly launched an initiative to combat plastic waste on the beach of Norddeich-Mole in northern Germany.8 This story anchors her lifelong dedication to sustainability in a personal and relatable experience. Furthermore, her biography notes a family history that includes a migration background, with relatives having fled Romania. This experience is presented as a source of her commitment to human rights and her deeply held conviction that education is the fundamental key to personal development and societal progress.10

### **2.2. Early Career and Corporate Trajectory**

Before establishing her current portfolio of academic and entrepreneurial roles, Prof. Ternes von Hattburg built a career in corporate management, gaining significant international experience in business development, marketing, and sales. This phase of her career is a cornerstone of her professional identity, allowing her to position herself as a thought leader whose insights are validated by real-world executive practice. Her public profile explicitly frames her move to SRH University in 2011 as a deliberate "step from practice to science," a narrative that bridges the common gap between corporate and academic worlds.5 This dual identity enhances her credibility and appeal to diverse audiences, from corporate clients seeking consulting to academic institutions and global think tanks.

Her key corporate roles include:

* **Samsonite (2006-2008):** She served as Head of Business Development for Luxury Europe and Head of Retail for Central Europe and Emerging Markets. This position at a major global consumer brand provided her with top-level strategic experience in international markets.3  
* **Fielmann (2004-2006):** As Sales Director (Verkaufsleiterin) for the major European optical company, she held a significant leadership role in sales management.3  
* **IHR (Ideal Home Range) (1997-2004):** She served as Head of Marketing and Sales Development, a role she held while concurrently pursuing her part-time diplomas in business administration and education.3

This background in established, international companies provides a practical foundation for her later work as a professor, author, and consultant on topics of management, communication, and sustainable business development.

## **Section 3: Analysis of Current Professional Roles and Entrepreneurial Ventures**

Prof. Ternes von Hattburg's current professional life is characterized by a complex and interwoven set of roles spanning academia, corporate leadership, and entrepreneurship. This multifaceted structure appears designed to maximize influence and create synergies across different sectors.

### **3.1. Academic Leadership: SRH Institute for Innovation & Sustainable Management**

The bedrock of her professional authority is her academic position. She serves as the Managing Director of the Berlin-based SRH Institute for Innovation & Sustainable Management, which is also referred to as the International Institute for Sustainability Management (IISM).6 Concurrently, she holds a professorship in Communication Management at SRH University.6

A significant detail that enhances her academic prestige is the lineage of her professorship. She is the successor to the chair founded by Dieter Kronzucker, a highly respected journalist and founder of the prominent ZDF television news magazine *heute journal*.8 This connection firmly places her within a distinguished tradition of German communication studies.

The institute she directs is part of the larger SRH network, a major state-recognized private foundation operating universities, clinics, and schools across Germany.14 SRH University offers a wide array of degree programs, including several Master's programs directly aligned with her expertise, such as "International Business \- Sustainability Management," "Social Design & Sustainable Innovation," and "ESG & Sustainability Law".15 This institutional ecosystem provides a rich environment for her work, offering research opportunities, a platform for her teaching, and a direct connection to the next generation of leaders in sustainability. The faculty for these programs includes colleagues such as Prof. Dr. Cordelia Friesendorf and Prof. Dr. Farzaneh Soleimani Zoghi.17

### **3.2. Corporate Leadership: The "Sustain Plus" and "BrightShift" Ambiguity**

In her public profiles, particularly for speaking engagements and on professional networks, Prof. Ternes von Hattburg is consistently identified by the title of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of two main corporate entities: "Sustain Plus GmbH" and "BrightShift Media Groupe".8 These titles are central to her branding as a hands-on business leader. However, an analysis of publicly available data reveals a critical discrepancy between these stated roles and verifiable corporate information, a point of significant importance for any due diligence process.

Analysis of "Sustain Plus":  
The name "Sustain Plus" is most prominently associated with the Sustain Plus Energy Foundation, a well-documented non-profit organization based in India.22 This foundation focuses on providing decentralized renewable energy (DRE) solutions to underserved communities in India and is a collaboration between Social Alpha, Selco Foundation, and Collectives for Integrated Livelihoods Initiatives (CInI).22 Its board of directors includes Harish Handerto Hande, Manoj Kumar, and Ganesh Satish Neelam.24 There is no publicly documented connection between this Indian foundation and Prof. Ternes von Hattburg. The website for the German entity she is associated with, sustainplus.de, was found to be inaccessible during the research period, preventing further verification of its activities, team, or scale.25  
Analysis of "BrightShift":  
The name "BrightShift" is linked to several distinct and seemingly unrelated international companies, creating potential for significant confusion:

* A US-based company, **BrightShift**, founded by Rachel Sullivan and Jamie Morgan Cross, which specializes in corporate development workshops and in-house video production.26  
* A UK-based social impact marketing agency, **Bright/Shift**, founded by Toby Stewart, which works with sustainable brands.27  
* A US-based education technology company, **BrightShift**, that focuses on student data privacy compliance.28  
* A German entity named **Bright Shift Group**, with registered addresses in Kluse and Würzburg, Germany, but which has a minimal public web presence and no discernible link to Prof. Ternes von Hattburg in the available materials.30

The consistent use of these CEO titles in high-profile contexts, such as speaker biographies for the Finance Summit and ZP Europe, establishes a strong public perception of her as a corporate leader.20 Yet, the lack of a clear, verifiable public record for a significant German "Sustain Plus GmbH" or "BrightShift Media Groupe" under her leadership creates an information vacuum. For a professional audience conducting due diligence, this discrepancy is a notable red flag. It raises questions about the operational reality and scale of these ventures. The inability to independently verify these primary corporate affiliations and the potential for misattribution with other established international firms constitute a reputational risk that must be factored into any assessment of her professional profile.

### **3.3. Entrepreneurial and Founding Activities**

Prof. Ternes von Hattburg identifies as a "serial founder" and has initiated multiple ventures, most of which align with her focus on sustainability, education, and social impact.21 Her entrepreneurial activities include:

* **GetYourWings gGmbH:** A non-profit (gGmbH) company she founded, which focuses on developing digital literacy and future skills through educational tools. Its projects include online learning games like "Code and Safe the Planet".2  
* **Experts for Life:** A venture founded in April 2024\. It is listed in her speaker profiles for various summits, though specific details on its services are limited in the provided materials.8  
* **Other Ventures:** She is also named as a founder or co-founder of several other startups, including **CoCarrier**, **Psychologio**, and the health service provider **HealthMedo**, which focuses on mental health.3

### **3.4. Awards and Professional Recognition**

Her professional standing is reinforced by a multitude of awards and honors from diverse institutions, which serve to validate her influence and expertise in her key domains. These accolades include:

* **LinkedIn Top Voice (Sustainability):** This is a recurring and highly visible recognition that underscores her influence on one of the world's leading professional networks.8  
* **Futurology and Business Acumen:** She has been named "FEMALE FUTUROLOGIST OF THE YEAR" and "CEO eLEARNING OF THE YEAR".10 Furthermore, she is frequently cited as being recognized by Hypovereinsbank as "one of Germany's outstanding managers and entrepreneurs".8 Forbes has referred to her as a "Superwoman," and Handelsblatt has named her one of Germany's "thought leaders and visionaries".10  
* **Social and Community Impact:** She is a recipient of the **Google Impact Challenge Award** for her work.8 She was also appointed as an ambassador for the  
  **"FRAUEN UNTERNEHMEN" (WOMEN IN BUSINESS)** initiative, which is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.8

## **Section 4: Intellectual Footprint and Media Influence**

Prof. Ternes von Hattburg maintains a significant public profile through her prolific work as an author, journalist, and media host. These activities are central to disseminating her ideas, building her brand, and cultivating her extensive professional network.

### **4.1. Prolific Author and Editor**

She is credited as the author, co-author, or editor of over 50 books, a substantial body of work that establishes her as a leading voice in her fields.12 Her publications consistently explore her core themes of sustainability, digitalization, future skills, corporate health, and new leadership paradigms.

Her work is often collaborative, as evidenced by her numerous co-authored and co-edited volumes. Notable publications include the co-edited book *Future Skills: 30 Zukunftsentscheidende Kompetenzen und wie wir sie lernen können* ("Future Skills: 30 Decisive Competencies for the Future and How We Can Learn Them"), a practical guide created with 69 contributors.34 Other key titles include

*Nachhaltiges Management* ("Sustainable Management"), *Agenda HR – Digitalisierung, Arbeit 4.0, New Leadership*, and *Effiziente Krisenkommunikation* ("Efficient Crisis Communication").37 A comprehensive list of her publications and co-authors is provided in Appendix A.

### **4.2. Journalist and Media Personality**

In addition to her books, Prof. Ternes von Hattburg is an active journalist and media personality. She contributes as a freelance journalist to publications such as *FOCUS online* and has worked as a television and radio host.8

She hosts the radio talk show "We Empower\!" on the UK HEALTH RADIO network, a platform that aligns with her focus on health and well-being.12 She also hosts the "Inspiring Minds" podcast, which serves as a powerful and strategic tool for network development and brand amplification.38 An analysis of the podcast's guest list reveals a carefully curated selection of high-profile leaders, innovators, and changemakers. Guests include figures such as

**Tessy Antony de Nassau** (entrepreneur and former member of the Luxembourg royal family), **Felix Finkbeiner** (founder of the global environmental organization Plant-for-the-Planet), **The Green Sheikh** (H.E. Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Ali Al Nuaimi, an environmental diplomat from the UAE), **Dr. Rüdiger Dahlke** (a prominent German physician and author in holistic medicine), and **Claudine Nierth** (a leading German activist for participatory democracy).38

These interviews function as more than simple conversations. They are public-facing collaborations that create a durable record of her association with influential individuals, thereby enhancing her own status and credibility by proximity. The format allows her to deepen professional relationships with individuals who are often part of her other networks; for example, her interview with Felix Finkbeiner reinforces her connection to Plant-for-the-Planet, where she serves on the pedagogical board. The resulting content—podcasts, videos, and social media clips—functions as marketing material that reinforces her brand as a convener of "inspiring minds" and a thought leader in her own right. The podcast is, therefore, a central and highly effective engine within her broader ecosystem of influence.

## **Section 5: Comprehensive Network Analysis**

Prof. Ternes von Hattburg's influence is significantly magnified by her active participation in an extensive and diverse network of organizations, boards, and collaborative partnerships. Her affiliations place her within key circles of influence in global policy, social impact, transatlantic relations, and corporate governance. A complete, itemized list of these connections is provided in Appendix A. The following sections summarize the key categories of her network.

### **5.1. Global Think Tanks and Advocacy Networks**

This is the core of her international influence, connecting her with some of the world's most recognized forums for global issues.

* **Club of Budapest:** She holds the prominent position of President of the Club of Budapest Germany.8 This role connects her directly with the organization's overarching mission of fostering a new global consciousness and its founder, the systems philosopher  
  **Ervin Laszlo**. Her key colleagues in the German chapter include Vice-President **Peter Helbig** and International Ambassador **Peter Spiegel**.40  
* **Club of Rome:** She is a full member of the Club of Rome, an influential international think tank composed of scientists, economists, and business leaders that addresses complex global challenges.10  
* **Plant for the Planet:** She serves on the Pedagogical Experts Board and acts as an advisor to this global youth environmental organization.8 This role establishes a direct working relationship with its founder,  
  **Felix Finkbeiner**, whom she has also featured on her podcast.38  
* **Friends of Social Business:** Her position as a Board Member of this organization connects her to the work and network of its founder, Nobel Peace Prize laureate **Muhammad Yunus**.31  
* **Transatlantic and International Relations:** Her membership in **Atlantik-Brücke**, a private, non-profit association that promotes German-American understanding, places her within a key network of leaders from business, politics, and academia in both countries.10 She is also a member of  
  **UN Women Germany**, aligning her with the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women.10  
* **Fellowships and Other Affiliations:** She is a Fellow of both **Nexus Global**, a community of young philanthropists and social entrepreneurs, and the prestigious **Aspen Institute**.10 Additionally, she is a partner member of the  
  **German UN Ocean Decade Committee**, further cementing her role in high-level sustainability initiatives.34

### **5.2. Board and Advisory Roles**

Prof. Ternes von Hattburg holds numerous board and advisory positions across a range of foundations and corporations. These roles signify a high level of trust in her expertise and provide her with governance experience and additional networking platforms.

* **Foundations:** She is a member of the Supervisory Board at the **Sir Peter Ustinov Stiftung** and the **INGLOSUS Foundation**.19  
* **Corporate Boards:** Her advisory roles in the corporate sector include positions on the advisory boards of **NEON EQUITY AG** (an investment firm), the **Octopus Group**, and **IIC International Impact Consulting AG**.19  
* **Other Organizational Boards:** She is listed as a supervisory board member of **PAN** (Physicians Association for Nutrition) and a board member of **Physicians Association for Nutrition International**.8

### **5.3. Academic and Literary Collaborators**

Her intellectual network is most evident in her extensive list of co-authors and co-editors. This demonstrates a strong capacity for collaborative research and the ability to convene diverse experts to produce thought leadership. As detailed in Appendix A, her key collaborators on published works include **W. Grenke, S. Bachmann, A. Grünberg, Peter Spiegel, M. Schäfer, C. Troxler, M. Englert, C.-D. Wilke, H.-P. Hagemes, B. Klenke,** and **I. Towers**, among many others.4

### **5.4. Formative Influences**

Her professional development in the field of futurology was shaped by specific, high-level training. Her biography notes that her education in trend scouting and management was conducted under the guidance of **Li Edelkoort** and **Mieke de Bock**, two luminaries in the fields of trend forecasting and design thinking.8 This connection points to a specialized and influential stream of thought that informs her current work and professional identity.

## **Section 6: Synthesis and Strategic Conclusion**

The public profile of Prof. Dr. Anabel Ternes von Hattburg is that of a master architect of a complex, self-reinforcing ecosystem of influence. Her career is not defined by a single, hierarchical role but by her strategic positioning as a central and trusted node connecting the powerful, and often siloed, worlds of academia, business, media, and global advocacy.

Each component of her professional life is designed to legitimize and amplify the others. Her academic directorship and professorship at SRH University provide a foundation of intellectual credibility and access to research. Her entrepreneurial activities and stated CEO titles furnish her with a business-leader persona, making her relatable to corporate audiences. Her memberships in elite global think tanks like the Club of Rome and her presidency of the Club of Budapest Germany confer global standing and provide unparalleled access to international policy and thought leadership circles. Her prolific output as an author and her media platforms, particularly her podcast, serve as powerful engines for disseminating her message, amplifying her brand, and cultivating her network. Finally, her numerous board roles provide her with governance experience and further expand her web of high-level connections.

The synergistic nature of this structure is evident in the cross-pollination between her activities. She serves on the board of Plant for the Planet and uses her podcast to interview its founder, Felix Finkbeiner. She co-edits a book on future skills with Peter Spiegel, a key colleague from the Club of Budapest Germany. This interwoven strategy creates a powerful network effect that is the primary source of her public influence.

The only significant vulnerability identified in this analysis of her public profile is the lack of transparency and potential for misattribution concerning her primary corporate entities, Sustain Plus GmbH and BrightShift Media Groupe. The discrepancy between her prominent use of CEO titles and the absence of readily verifiable public data for these specific German companies under her leadership stands in contrast to the otherwise well-documented and robust nature of her professional activities. For any organization conducting a thorough due diligence assessment, this information gap would require further investigation to fully understand the nature and scale of these ventures and to mitigate any potential reputational risk associated with the ambiguity.
