## **Executive Summary: The Profile of Sven Wackermann**

Sven Wackermann presents a compelling profile of a modern professional operating at the intersection of technology and public service. His career is characterized by a dual track: a senior role in Germany's dynamic financial technology (fintech) sector and a long-standing, influential position in Munich's local politics. This report establishes that these two paths are not parallel but deeply intertwined, with his professional expertise in digitalization forming the bedrock of his political identity and authority.

Professionally, Mr. Wackermann serves as the Head of Product Management ("Leiter Produktmanagement") at finAPI, a pioneering Open Banking provider in Munich.1 His tenure of over eight years places him at the heart of the company's evolution through critical phases, including significant European mergers and acquisitions. Politically, he is a veteran of the Christian Social Union (CSU), with extensive experience in the Pasing-Obermenzing district committee and a notable, though brief, term in the Munich City Council (Stadtrat).3

The synergy between these roles defines his influence. His professional credentials lend significant weight to his political platform, particularly on the key issue of digitalization, while his political network embeds him within the governance structures of one of Germany's most important economic and technological hubs. This unique combination makes Sven Wackermann a figure of interest for any analysis of the confluence of technology, finance, and politics in Munich.

## **Professional Trajectory: A Leader in Germany's Open Banking Evolution**

Sven Wackermann's professional career is anchored at finAPI, where he holds a leadership position. His work is situated within the context of a company that has been a key player in the evolution of Open Finance in Germany and Europe, navigating significant corporate transformations along the way.

### **finAPI: Corporate Identity and Market Position**

finAPI GmbH is a prominent German provider of Open Banking and Open Finance solutions. Founded in Munich in 2008 by Dr. Florian Haagen and Dr. Martin Lacher, the company established itself as a pioneer in the sector.6 It holds a critical license from Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) as an account information and payment initiation service, a regulatory status that validates its operations and provides market access.6

The company's core offering is a banking API that enables B2B clients—including banks, other fintechs, and insurance companies—to aggregate and analyze financial data with end-user consent.8 This technology underpins a range of digital services, such as automated Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, streamlined credit application processes, and payment initiation.6 The scale of its operations is substantial; in 2023, the combined entity of Fabrick and finAPI handled over 11 billion API calls and served a client base of more than 800 companies.7

### **Sven Wackermann's Role: Head of Product Management**

Sven Wackermann is publicly identified as the "Leiter Produktmanagement" (Head of Product Management) at finAPI.1 His LinkedIn profile indicates a tenure of over eight years, meaning he has been with the company through its most transformative periods of growth and ownership changes.

In this capacity, he plays a pivotal role in shaping the company's product portfolio. He is responsible for translating strategic objectives into tangible software solutions. The centrality of his position is highlighted in company job postings, which state that developers "work closely with the Product Manager... to achieve the biggest possible benefit of using finAPI for our customers".10 This demonstrates his direct involvement and collaborative leadership within the product development lifecycle.

He is also the public face of specific product initiatives. In a May 2023 interview, Wackermann discussed the "finAPI KreditCheck," a web-based platform designed to digitize the credit approval workflow for banks. He articulated how the product leverages Open Banking to conduct real-time creditworthiness checks via account analysis, offering a "Zero-Integration-Lösung" (zero-integration solution) that avoids complex and costly backend IT projects for clients.1 This public advocacy showcases his deep domain expertise and his role in communicating the value of finAPI's technology to the market.

### **Navigating Corporate Transformation: The M\&A Journey of finAPI**

Mr. Wackermann's leadership has been tested against a backdrop of significant corporate change, marked by a failed merger attempt and a subsequent successful acquisition. This period of strategic realignment would have required considerable adaptability from the company's product leadership.

For several years, finAPI was majority-owned (75%) by SCHUFA Holding AG, Germany's leading credit bureau.7 In May 2022, a major transaction was announced: SCHUFA had agreed to sell its stake to Yapily, a UK-based Open Banking platform. The deal was presented by the respective CEOs—Stefano Vaccino of Yapily, Florian Haagen of finAPI, and Tanja Birkholz of SCHUFA—as a move that would create "Europe's leading open banking platform".11 As Head of Product Management, Wackermann would have been integral to planning the complex process of integrating the two companies' product roadmaps and technological platforms.

However, this announced merger did not materialize. While the available documents do not specify the reason for its collapse, by May 2024, a new and different acquisition was announced.7 This period of high-level corporate uncertainty between 2022 and 2024 would have posed a significant challenge, requiring internal leaders like Wackermann to maintain team morale and adapt product strategy in a fluid environment. His continued senior role at the company suggests he successfully navigated this complex phase.

In May 2024, Italian Open Finance company Fabrick S.p.A. announced it would acquire the 75% stake from SCHUFA, a deal that was finalized in June 2025\.13 The founders, Dr. Haagen and Dr. Lacher, retained their 25% ownership and were slated to "continue to play a role in the unified entity".7 Fabrick CEO Paolo Zaccardi described the acquisition as a "strategic step in our European journey," while finAPI CEO Florian Haagen noted it would allow the company to offer a "broader portfolio of digital Open Finance solutions".13 This successful transaction positions Sven Wackermann and his product team at the center of a major European fintech consolidation, tasked with integrating and innovating within a larger international framework.

## **Political Career: A CSU Mainstay in Munich's Municipal Government**

Parallel to his career in technology, Sven Wackermann has cultivated a long and substantive political career as a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Munich. His involvement spans decades and includes progressively senior roles, from deep-rooted activity in his home district to a seat in the city-wide parliament.

### **Foundation of Power: The Pasing-Obermenzing District Committee (BA 21\)**

The foundation of Mr. Wackermann's political influence lies in his extensive and continuous service on the District Committee 21 (BA 21\) for Pasing-Obermenzing. Public records show his involvement dates back to at least September 2008, demonstrating a durable commitment to local governance.3

Throughout his tenure, he has been deeply integrated into the committee's work, serving not only on the main plenary body (BA 21 \- Vollgremium) but also on key sub-committees focused on Planning (UA 21 \- Planung) and Culture & Local Heritage (UA 21 \- Kultur und Heimatpflege).3 His expertise and standing within the party are reflected in his leadership roles. For the 2020-2026 legislative period, he is the CSU's

**Faction Spokesman** (Fraktionssprecher) and the **Chairman** of the "Culture, Local History, and Organization" subcommittee, positions that underscore his authority and responsibility within the local party caucus.15

| Term | Political Body | Role / Committee Membership | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sep 2008 \- Apr 2014 | BA 21 Pasing-Obermenzing | Member, Plenary Committee (Vollgremium) | 3 |
| May 2014 \- Apr 2020 | BA 21 Pasing-Obermenzing | Member, Plenary Committee (Vollgremium); Member, Planning Subcommittee (UA Planung) | 3 |
| Jun 2019 \- Apr 2020 | Munich City Council (Stadtrat) | City Council Member (Successor) | 4 |
| May 2020 \- Present | BA 21 Pasing-Obermenzing | Member, Plenary Committee (Vollgremium); Faction Spokesman (CSU); Chairman, Culture, Local History, and Organization Subcommittee; Member, Planning Subcommittee | 3 |

### **Ascension to the City Council (Stadtrat)**

In June 2019, Sven Wackermann reached a significant milestone in his political career when he was appointed to the Munich City Council (Stadtrat).4 He did not win the seat in a general election but was elevated as a "Nachrücker" (successor) to fill a vacancy.5

The vacancy was created by the departure of **Josef Schmid**, a highly influential CSU figure who had served as Munich's Second Mayor and was leaving the council following his election to the Bavarian State Parliament (Landtag).5 Succeeding a politician of Schmid's stature, even for the final year of the legislative term, is a strong indicator of Wackermann's standing and reliability within the party. It suggests he was identified by the party leadership as the designated successor for this important role.

Upon joining the City Council, news reports immediately highlighted that his primary policy interest was **"Digitalisierung"** (Digitalization).5 This created an explicit and powerful link between his professional life at a leading fintech company and his new public role as a city-wide legislator. While his mandate as a city council member concluded with the 2020 municipal elections, the experience provided him with invaluable visibility and experience at the highest level of city government.4

### **CSU Party Involvement**

Beyond his elected and appointed offices, Mr. Wackermann holds a formal position within the CSU's internal party structure. He is listed as a **"Stellv. Ortsvorsitzender" (Deputy Local Chairman)** of the CSU's Pasing local association.18 This role places him in the core leadership team of his local party branch, where he is involved in organizational matters, political strategy, and campaign activities alongside the local chairman, Winfried Kaum.

## **Nexus of Influence: A Comprehensive Analysis of Associates and Collaborators**

Sven Wackermann's influence is best understood by examining the network of individuals he interacts with across his professional and political domains. This network includes fintech executives who are shaping European Open Finance and a host of political figures who govern the city of Munich.

### **The Fintech Network: Executives, Founders, and Partners**

As Head of Product Management at finAPI, Wackermann operates within a network of key figures in the European fintech ecosystem. His role necessitates close collaboration with internal teams and strategic alignment with corporate leadership and partners.

His most immediate professional collaborators are the founders of finAPI, **Dr. Florian Haagen** (CEO) and **Dr. Martin Lacher**. As a department head, he would work in close concert with the CEO to execute the company's product vision.7 Following the 2024 acquisition, this circle of influence expanded to include

**Paolo Zaccardi**, the CEO of finAPI's new parent company, Fabrick. Zaccardi's vision for European consolidation now sets the strategic direction for Wackermann's product team.12 Another key external figure has been

**Tanja Birkholz**, the CEO of SCHUFA, whose decisions as the leader of the former parent company directly shaped the strategic transformations Wackermann has had to navigate.7 Internally, his role requires direct collaboration with other department heads, such as those for Compliance, Operations, and Sales, as well as with his own team members, including

**Customer Success Managers** and **Java Developers**.10

### **The Political Network: CSU Colleagues and Municipal Leaders**

Wackermann's political network is extensive and deeply rooted in Munich's CSU party machine. His most high-profile connection is to **Josef Schmid**, the former Second Mayor of Munich, whom he succeeded in the City Council in 2019\.5 This succession links him directly to the upper echelon of the city's political establishment.

At the local level, he maintains a close working relationship with **Winfried Kaum**, who is both his superior as Chairman of the CSU Pasing local association and a colleague on the Pasing-Obermenzing District Committee. Kaum is also a current member of the Munich City Council, providing a direct link from the district to city-wide politics.15 Wackermann works under the leadership of

**Frieder Vogelsgesang**, the Chairman of the BA 21, and alongside a cohort of long-serving CSU district committee members, including **Maria Osterhuber-Völkl, Lorenz Strohmeir, Katrin Högn,** and **Wolfgang Hechtl**.15

His network also extends to the federal level through **Dr. Stephan Pilsinger**, a Member of the German Bundestag (MdB) who is the CSU District Chairman for Munich West. Pilsinger and Wackermann served together on the Pasing-Obermenzing District Committee, connecting Wackermann's local activities to a representative in the national parliament.17 During his 2019-2020 term on the City Council, his colleagues included the entire CSU faction, led by Faction Chairman

**Manuel Pretzl** and veteran council members like **Dr. Evelyne Menges** and **Beatrix Burkhardt**.22

## **Synthesis and Forward-Looking Analysis**

The examination of Sven Wackermann's professional and political careers reveals a uniquely positioned individual whose influence derives from the powerful synthesis of these two domains. His trajectory is emblematic of an increasing convergence of technological expertise and public governance.

### **The Digitalization Bridge: From Fintech Practitioner to Policy Advocate**

A critical element of Wackermann's profile is the authentic authority he brings to political discussions on technology. When he entered the Munich City Council with "Digitalisierung" as his stated focus, it was not the adoption of a political buzzword but the declaration of his core professional competence.5 As the Head of Product Management for a leading Open Banking firm, he is an active, senior practitioner in the very field he seeks to influence through policy.1

This background provides a level of subject-matter expertise that is uncommon in political chambers. In a governmental environment often challenged by the complexities of digital transformation, his ability to speak from direct experience on topics like data security, API integration, and digital financial services lends his voice a credibility that career politicians may lack. This positions him as a valuable internal resource for his party and a more persuasive advocate for technology-driven policies in the public sphere.

### **A Profile of Calculated Ambition**

Wackermann's career path suggests a pattern of steady, patient, and calculated advancement. His decade-plus service at the district committee level demonstrates a commitment to the foundational work of grassroots politics, building a strong local power base.3 His elevation to the City Council upon Josef Schmid's departure indicates that this long-term dedication had positioned him strategically within the party as a trusted figure ready for promotion.5 His accumulation of leadership roles—Deputy Party Chairman locally, Faction Spokesman, and Committee Chairman in the district—further illustrates a deliberate and successful effort to build influence.15 His return to a primary focus on district politics after his Stadtrat tenure does not appear to be a retreat, but rather a strategic consolidation of his influence in his home district of Munich West.

### **Potential Synergies and Unstated Questions**

The dual nature of Sven Wackermann's career creates powerful synergies. He possesses an insider's understanding of the needs and operations of the technology and finance industries, coupled with a practitioner's knowledge of the mechanisms of municipal government. This allows him to bridge two worlds that are increasingly dependent on one another.

This profile also naturally gives rise to questions for which publicly available information provides no answers. These are not allegations but logical points of consideration inherent to such a dual role. The primary question concerns the management of potential conflicts of interest between his duties as a product leader for a private financial technology company and his responsibilities as a public official in a city that is a major consumer and regulator of technology. The available evidence strongly suggests his business expertise provides a political advantage to his party and his own platform. Whether his political network provides a reciprocal advantage to his business is an open question.

In conclusion, Sven Wackermann is a uniquely positioned figure whose career embodies the growing fusion of technological innovation and civic governance. He is a technocrat with a political power base, and a politician with deep technical expertise, making him a significant and influential actor at the nexus of Munich's economic and political life.
