# **An Analysis of the Melton Foundation's Global Solvers Accelerator Program and its 2025 Cohort**

## **I. Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Melton Foundation's Global Solvers Accelerator (GSA) program, focusing on its structure, objectives, and participants, particularly the 2025 cohort. The GSA is an intensive, 8-month leadership program designed for young social impact practitioners (aged 20-35) actively working on projects aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 Its primary purpose is to serve as a catalyst and accelerator, refining participants' existing projects and enhancing their capacity for transformative impact through peer learning, expert mentorship, and a curriculum grounded in the Foundation's core principle of global citizenship.1

Key findings indicate that the GSA program successfully identified and convened a diverse cohort of 20 project leaders for 2025, representing a wide range of geographical regions and SDG focus areas. Publicly available professional information, primarily LinkedIn profiles and some project websites, was compiled for these participants. The program structure emphasizes collaborative action, cross-boundary exchange, and practical application of learned concepts—such as systems thinking and collective leadership—directly to participants' ongoing social impact initiatives.2 A central component is the fully-sponsored, in-person Global Solvers Co-Lab, designed to deepen collaboration and network ties.2 While the Foundation provides substantial information on the current program and cohort, research encountered limitations in accessing comprehensive historical cohort data and consistently verifying public contact details beyond professional networking profiles. Nonetheless, the GSA stands out as a targeted initiative by the Melton Foundation to actively scale existing social impact projects, moving beyond general leadership development to foster tangible progress on global challenges.

## **II. The Melton Foundation: Context and Mission**

Understanding the Global Solvers Accelerator requires context regarding its parent organization, the Melton Foundation. Established in 1991 by tech entrepreneur Bill Melton and peace activist Patricia Smith, the Foundation was inspired by the potential of young people observed during significant global shifts, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and transformations in Chile, China, and India.4 Their conviction was that bringing together talented youth from diverse, rapidly changing environments could create a network capable of positive global impact.4

The Foundation's core **Mission** is to promote and enable global citizenship as a means for individuals and organizations to collaborate across boundaries of place and identity to address global challenges.3 Its **Vision** is to be a leading proponent of this practice, achieved through hands-on projects and activities involving a growing network.3 This network has expanded significantly since 1991, now comprising over 600 Senior Fellows globally, forming a lifelong community.6

The Foundation's work is guided by several **Core Values** 3:

- **Global Citizenship:** A duty to mobilize the network for local and global action.
- **Respect:** Acknowledging cultural differences and understanding multiple perspectives.
- **Curiosity:** A passion for interdisciplinary learning and action.
- **Trust, Responsibility, and Reciprocity:** Practicing open communication and accountability as the basis for a supportive global network and lifelong relationships.

This long-standing commitment, dating back to its inception, provides the philosophical foundation for all its programs, including the GSA. The emphasis on "Global Citizenship" frames the GSA's project acceleration activities not merely as technical or managerial support, but fundamentally as an exercise in cross-boundary collaboration, mutual learning, and shared responsibility for tackling complex global issues, aligning directly with the UN SDGs.3

## **III. Deep Dive: The Global Solvers Accelerator (GSA) Program**

### **A. Program Overview and Objectives**

The Global Solvers Accelerator (GSA) is a signature program of the Melton Foundation, distinctively positioned as an 8-month, project-based, peer-driven leadership initiative.1 It targets young adults, specifically those aged 20-35, who are already invested in social impact work and are actively leading or involved in an existing project within their community.1

The central objective of the GSA is multifaceted: it serves as a learning platform, a catalyst for new thinking, and an accelerator for the participants' ongoing social impact projects.1 The program aims to help participants refine, scale, and ultimately unleash the fullest transformative potential of their work, specifically contributing towards the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 It moves beyond theoretical learning by demanding direct application to real-world initiatives. Successful completion of the GSA offers participants a pathway into the Melton Foundation's lifelong Senior Fellow network, integrating them into a broader community of global citizens.2

The program's design intentionally blends individual project acceleration with intensive cohort-based peer learning. This structure suggests a core belief within the Foundation that the cross-pollination of ideas, experiences, and contextual knowledge among diverse practitioners from different parts of the world is a critical factor in unlocking innovative solutions and transformative potential, complementing the guidance received from subject matter experts.1

### **B. Program Structure and Methodology**

The GSA unfolds over eight months, structured around eight interconnected thematic modules designed to build capacity for transformative social impact.1 The program employs a blended learning pedagogy, combining various interactive and applied learning methods.1 Key components include:

- **Online Workshops:** Bi-weekly live sessions conducted online (e.g., via Zoom) provide forums for deliberation on monthly topics and their practical application to participants' projects.1
- **Project Assignments:** Tasks are designed to be directly relevant and applicable to the participants' ongoing social impact work.1
- **Peer Exchange:** Significant emphasis is placed on peer-to-peer learning and collaboration, leveraging the diverse experiences within the cohort.1
- **Subject Matter Advisory and Mentoring:** Participants receive tailored guidance and support from experts relevant to their project needs.1
- **Curated Resources:** Each module provides access to carefully selected materials.1

The curriculum covers a comprehensive range of topics essential for effective social impact leadership. These include practical areas like project effectiveness, team dynamics, impact modeling, audience engagement, strategic visibility, and monitoring & evaluation.1 Crucially, the curriculum extends beyond standard project management to incorporate higher-level frameworks such as collective leadership, systems thinking, (eco)systemic stakeholder mapping, and understanding social innovation and transformation.1 This breadth indicates an ambition to cultivate leaders who not only manage projects efficiently but also understand the complex systems within which they operate and can drive deeper, more systemic change.

Participation in the GSA involves a program fee of 800 USD, payable upon selection. However, recognizing potential financial barriers, the Foundation offers scholarships covering up to 80% of the fee for participants who demonstrate financial need and provide supporting documentation, such as a personal statement and an endorsement letter.1 Full scholarships are explicitly stated as not being available.1

### **C. The Global Solvers Co-Lab**

A distinctive and integral feature of the GSA program is the Global Solvers Co-Lab, a fully-sponsored, week-long in-person retreat for actively engaged participants.2 This intensive gathering serves as a focal point of the 8-month journey, designed to translate the virtual learning and connections into tangible collaboration and network strengthening.2

The Co-Lab functions as a dynamic "collaborative laboratory" where participants from diverse sectors, cultures, and geographies converge to delve deeply into global challenges, learn from each other, and co-create meaningful solutions to advance the SDGs within their local contexts.9 Activities often include project visits to local initiatives, expert-led workshops, intensive small-group work in "Synergy Circles," networking opportunities, and cultural exchange sessions.12 The location of the Co-Lab varies, having been held or planned in Germany (Gotha/Jena for 2023 and 2025) and Ghana (Accra for 2024), reflecting the program's global nature.2

Key partners, such as the Ernst-Abbe-Stiftung based in Germany, have provided significant support for the Co-Lab, highlighting the collaborative nature of the Foundation's work.9 The intensity and in-person nature of the Co-Lab suggest its critical role in solidifying the cohort's bonds, fostering deeper project integration, and facilitating the transition of participants into the lifelong Melton Fellowship network, making it a cornerstone of the GSA's experiential learning model.

### **D. Eligibility and Application**

Eligibility for the Global Solvers Accelerator is targeted towards young adults aged 20-35 who are deeply invested in social impact work.1 A crucial requirement is that applicants must be currently leading or actively involved in a concrete social impact project connected to a specific territory or community.1 Furthermore, this project must be ongoing and expected to continue for at least the duration of the 8-month program.1 This prerequisite firmly positions the GSA as an _accelerator_ for initiatives that have already demonstrated some level of activity and commitment, rather than an incubator for nascent ideas.1

The application process is open globally, welcoming candidates from any country, provided they meet the criteria and possess sufficient English language skills for full participation.1 Applications are submitted individually, with the applicant representing their project or initiative; if part of a group, one member applies on behalf of the project.1 The application itself is comprehensive and requires significant time investment.1

The selection process is multi-stage and competitive, involving review and culminating in a virtual assessment center for shortlisted candidates.1 The typical application window runs from mid-September to mid-December for cohorts starting the following spring.2

## **IV. Spotlight on the 2025 Global Solvers Accelerator Cohort**

### **A. Cohort Overview**

The 2025 Global Solvers Accelerator cohort comprises 20 project leaders, meticulously selected from a global pool of hundreds of applicants.2 This high degree of selectivity underscores the Foundation's focus on identifying individuals and projects demonstrating significant potential for transformative impact and a strong capacity for collaborative learning within the cohort model. The selected participants represent a wide array of geographical origins and project focus areas, collectively addressing diverse aspects of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, from climate action and education equity to human rights advocacy and sustainable livelihoods.2

## **V. Program Impact and Network Connections**

### **A. Intended Impact and Participant Development**

The Global Solvers Accelerator program is designed to generate impact on multiple levels simultaneously: for the individual participants, their local communities, and their global peers.2 For participants, the program aims to build leadership capacity and unlock their transformative potential. For their communities, the goal is to accelerate the impact of their social projects, driving sustainable development beyond conventional approaches. For the global cohort, the program fosters cross-boundary exchange and collaborative learning.2

Evidence suggests the program can be effective in fostering significant shifts in participant mindset and strategy. A detailed account from Peter Mukuka, a 2024 GSA participant and founder of Men of Honour (an organization empowering young men in Zambia), illustrates this potential impact.130 Mukuka explicitly credits the GSA program with transforming his understanding of leadership from a top-down, vision-driven approach to one centered on collective meaning-making and shared ownership.130 He noted, _"The moment I stepped back and let my team take ownership, the depth of our work increased"_.130

Furthermore, specific GSA activities, like the "failure story" exercise, prompted deep reflection and reframed his perspective on setbacks. Mukuka stated, _"That exercise changed everything for me... I realized that failure isn’t just a setback; it’s the clearest data I have on what needs to change"_.130 This suggests the program's reflective practices can lead to profound learning. The program also influenced his approach to scaling his project, shifting focus from quantity ("how can we do more") to quality and depth ("how can we do better").130 Learning specific concepts within the GSA, such as "Ecosystem Gardening," reportedly provided him with the confidence and strategic framework to approach growth more sustainably.130 His experience also highlights the program's role in broadening cultural awareness and appreciation through interaction with a diverse cohort.130 This qualitative evidence points towards the efficacy of the GSA's pedagogical blend—peer learning, reflective exercises, specific frameworks—in achieving its developmental goals beyond simple skill transfer, fostering deeper changes in leadership approach and strategic thinking.

### **B. Connection to Melton Fellowship and Lifelong Network**

The Global Solvers Accelerator serves as a critical pathway into the broader Melton Foundation ecosystem, specifically the lifelong Melton Fellowship.2 Established in 1991, the Foundation has cultivated a network of over 600 Senior Fellows hailing from diverse professional backgrounds and numerous world regions.5 This network represents over three decades of fostering cross-cultural connections and collaborative action.7

While the Foundation also runs the Global Citizenship Learning Program for younger university students 4, the GSA specifically targets individuals aged 20-35 who are already engaged in leading social impact projects. This positions the GSA not only as a project accelerator but also as a strategic pipeline for infusing the established, long-term Melton Fellows network with experienced, mid-career practitioners. By bringing in individuals with proven track records and ongoing initiatives, the GSA likely enriches the network's collective expertise, practical knowledge, and potential for collaborative impact, diversifying its membership beyond those who initially joined as undergraduate students. The GSA, therefore, plays a dual role: accelerating specific SDG-focused projects and strengthening the Foundation's core asset – its global network of committed change agents.

## **VI. Research Limitations and Information Gaps**

This analysis is based on publicly available information obtained primarily from the Melton Foundation's websites, associated project pages, professional networking profiles (mainly LinkedIn), and publicly accessible reports or news articles. Several limitations inherent in this approach should be acknowledged.

Firstly, comprehensive historical data on GSA cohorts prior to 2025 proved difficult to access. While the 2025 cohort is well-documented on the Foundation's site, similar detailed public listings for previous years were not readily found.2 This limits the ability to conduct longitudinal analysis of participant trajectories or comparative cohort studies based solely on public data.

Secondly, while LinkedIn profiles were a valuable source for professional background information on many 2025 participants, consistently verifying dedicated project websites and, particularly, public contact email addresses presented a significant challenge. Many project-specific websites were either not found, inaccessible during the research period, or did not clearly correspond to the GSA participant's specific initiative. Direct public email addresses for individuals were rarely listed on organizational or profile pages, often necessitating reliance on general organizational contact points or LinkedIn messaging.

Thirdly, assessing the program's impact relies heavily on information provided by the Melton Foundation itself, such as its annual reports 132 and participant testimonials or features published on its platforms.130 Independent, third-party evaluations or comprehensive impact assessments were not identified within the scope of this public information research.

These factors indicate that while the Melton Foundation offers considerable transparency regarding the GSA's structure, goals, and current participants, accessing granular historical data, easily verifiable direct contact information for outreach, and independent impact evaluations through public channels remains challenging for external parties.

## **VII. Conclusion**

The Melton Foundation's Global Solvers Accelerator represents a well-defined and strategically important initiative within the Foundation's broader mission to foster global citizenship and address complex global challenges. It functions as an intensive, 8-month program designed to accelerate existing SDG-focused projects led by young social impact practitioners (aged 20-35) from around the world. The program's unique methodology blends peer-to-peer learning within a diverse international cohort, expert mentorship, applied project work, and a curriculum emphasizing collective leadership, systems thinking, and transformative impact, all underpinned by the principles of global citizenship. The fully-sponsored, in-person Global Solvers Co-Lab serves as a crucial anchor for deepening collaboration and network building.

The 2025 cohort exemplifies the program's global reach and diverse focus, bringing together 20 leaders tackling issues ranging from climate action and sustainable architecture to education equity, human rights, and artisan empowerment across numerous countries. While public information readily provides details on the current cohort and program structure, accessing historical data and consistently verifying direct contact information for participants presents challenges.

Based on available information, particularly participant testimonials like that of Peter Mukuka, the GSA appears effective in fostering significant shifts in leadership perspectives, strategic approaches to social impact, and cross-cultural understanding. By serving as a key entry point to the lifelong Melton Fellowship, the GSA not only accelerates individual projects but also strategically enriches the Foundation's extensive global network with experienced practitioners, enhancing its capacity for sustained, collaborative action on the Sustainable Development Goals. The program stands as a notable model for developing globally-minded leaders equipped to navigate and influence complex social systems.
