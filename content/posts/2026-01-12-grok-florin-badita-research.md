Florin Badita-Nistor - Humanity in Action

**Florin Bădiță** (born c. 1988) is a Romanian activist, social entrepreneur, data scientist, and AI enthusiast. He is best known as the founder of the civic movement "Corruption Kills" (Corupția Ucide), which emerged in response to the 2015 Colectiv nightclub fire in Bucharest that claimed 64 lives due to systemic corruption and regulatory failures. Under his leadership, the movement organized some of Romania's largest protests since the 1989 Revolution, mobilizing up to 600,000 people to demand accountability and anti-corruption reforms. Bădiță has been recognized internationally for his digitally-enhanced activism, including being named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 Europe list in Law & Policy in 2018 and winning the European Personality of the Year award that same year.

In recent years, Bădiță has shifted focus toward data-driven initiatives, AI applications, and civic tech, collaborating on projects involving investigative journalism, community building, and artificial intelligence. He describes himself as a "realistic optimist" who leverages technology to drive social change.

## Early Life and Education

Details about Bădiță's early life are limited in public records, but he was born around 1988 in Romania. He has shared in talks that his path to activism began from a place of uncertainty, evolving into a commitment to civic engagement. Bădiță has a background in data science and technology, which he later applied to his activist work.

## Activism and "Corruption Kills"

Bădiță founded "Corruption Kills" in 2015 following the tragic Colectiv fire, where corruption-enabled safety violations led to 64 deaths, including a friend of his. The movement quickly grew into one of Romania's largest civic organizations, using social media and online platforms to rally support.

During the 2017–2019 Romanian protests, Bădiță played a pivotal role in coordinating demonstrations against government ordinances that aimed to decriminalize certain abuses of power and pardon crimes. These protests, often called the "Revolution of our generation," forced the withdrawal of the decrees and the resignation of Justice Minister Florin Iordache. The movement's efforts also supported investigative journalism in uncovering public embezzlement.

Bădiță has co-founded or contributed to nearly 20 initiatives, including OpenStreetMap Romania and other community-driven projects.
