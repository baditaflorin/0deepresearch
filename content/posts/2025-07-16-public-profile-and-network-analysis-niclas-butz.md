## **Section 1: Executive Summary**

### **1.1 Overview**

This report provides a comprehensive public profile and network analysis of Niclas Butz, a German executive operating at the intersection of private commercial enterprise and international public health advisory. Publicly available information identifies Mr. Butz as a seasoned executive with a multifaceted career spanning several organizations.1 His current professional activities are primarily centered around two key domains. In the commercial sector, he serves as the Chief Executive Officer of two distinct entities: Feraplant S.A., a company registered in Luxembourg, and Viverno GmbH, a German limited liability company.1 In the global health sector, he holds dual roles as an Ambassador and Senior Advisor for the Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx), a Geneva-based initiative of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).1 This dual positioning suggests a strategic approach that bridges for-profit innovation with non-profit global health objectives.

### **1.2 Key Findings**

The analysis of publicly accessible data reveals several key characteristics of Mr. Butz's professional profile. First, his corporate portfolio, particularly Viverno GmbH, is marked by a strategic ambiguity in its stated business purpose, encompassing a remarkably diverse range of industries from cosmetics to construction materials.2 This structure suggests a flexible investment or development vehicle rather than a conventional operating company. Second, his Luxembourg-based entity, Feraplant S.A., is characterized by a significant degree of corporate opacity, a feature consistent with the legal framework of its jurisdiction, which often attracts holding companies and private investment vehicles.3 Third, his high-level engagement with HIEx places him in a pivotal position within the global health ecosystem, offering significant access to policymakers, innovators, and investors.1 Finally, his verifiable professional network is compact, centered on key business associates within Viverno GmbH, with a broader, less defined circle of contacts suggested by attendance at international forums. A critical finding of this report is the necessity of distinguishing Mr. Butz from another German professional with a nearly identical name, a distinction vital for accurate intelligence.

### **1.3 Navigating Data Complexities**

The compilation of this report required careful navigation of several data challenges inherent in open-source intelligence. A primary challenge was the existence of a similarly named professional, Niklas Butz, an aerospace engineer associated with Deutsche Lufthansa AG.4 Differentiating between the two individuals was a critical first step to ensure data integrity. A second challenge arises from the corporate structure of Feraplant S.A. Its registration as a Société Anonyme in Luxembourg limits the public availability of shareholder information, creating an informational gap that is itself an important data point regarding the entity's likely function.3 Furthermore, the analysis of Mr. Butz's network required a critical evaluation of connections generated by professional networking platforms. Many such connections appear to be algorithmically suggested rather than indicative of a direct, substantive relationship.1 This report addresses these complexities by clearly identifying areas of ambiguity, qualifying the reliability of connections, and providing context for the structural reasons behind information gaps. This approach ensures a nuanced and accurate representation based strictly on the available evidence.

## **Section 2: Professional Biography and Career Trajectory**

### **2.1 Educational Background**

Niclas Butz's educational history points to an international upbringing and foundation. His profile lists studies at two distinct institutions: Gymnasium Eggenberg im St. Anna Colleg and the Nobel Algarve British International School.1 Gymnasium Eggenberg is located in Graz, Austria, suggesting a portion of his education was completed within the Austrian system. The Nobel Algarve British International School, located in Portugal, indicates exposure to a British international curriculum. This combination of educational experiences in different European countries suggests a multilingual and multicultural background, which is often advantageous for executives operating in an international business and diplomatic environment. The specific years of attendance, degrees, or fields of study are not specified in the available documentation.1

### **2.2 Career Timeline**

The publicly documented career of Niclas Butz shows a progression from a local Munich-based venture to leadership roles in internationally focused companies and a global health organization. The earliest available record places him as a Co-Owner at an entity identified as "MUC-FM" in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, a role he held for just over two years, from July 2012 to August 2014\.1

A significant shift in his career trajectory appears to have occurred in 2016\. In April of that year, he assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer at two separate companies simultaneously: Feraplant S.A. and Viverno GmbH.1 This marks the beginning of his current executive leadership period. His role at Feraplant S.A., a Luxembourg-based entity, and Viverno GmbH, a German company, indicates a cross-border management portfolio.

His engagement in the global health sector is a more recent development. In December 2023, he took on the position of Senior Advisor at the Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx).1 His LinkedIn profile also lists the title of Ambassador for HIEx, although a start date for this specific role is not provided.5 This dual advisory and ambassadorial capacity with a UNAIDS-backed organization represents a significant expansion of his professional activities into the non-profit and global policy sphere.

### **2.3 Geographic Footprint**

Niclas Butz maintains a distinct geographic footprint that aligns with his professional responsibilities. His primary base of operations is listed as Munich, Germany.1 This is consistent with his past role at MUC-FM and the registration of Viverno GmbH at the local court in Munich (Amtsgericht München).2

His professional activities, however, extend significantly beyond Germany. His leadership of Feraplant S.A. establishes a direct link to Luxembourg, a key European financial center known for its specific corporate legal environment.8 Most notably, his work with the Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx) connects him to Geneva, Switzerland, the organization's headquarters and a global hub for health and diplomacy.1 This triad of locations—Munich, Luxembourg, and Geneva—paints a picture of an executive who operates across multiple European jurisdictions, leveraging the unique advantages of each for his commercial and advisory roles.

## **Section 3: Analysis of Corporate Ventures and Holdings**

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the commercial entities directly associated with Niclas Butz. The structure and stated purpose of these companies offer significant clues into his business strategies, which appear to prioritize flexibility, intellectual property development, and the use of strategic corporate jurisdictions.

### **3.1 Viverno GmbH (Germany): A Multi-Faceted Enterprise**

Viverno GmbH stands out as Mr. Butz's primary German-based corporate vehicle. An examination of its history, leadership, and stated objectives reveals a company designed for operational agility and diverse ventures, underpinned by specific intellectual property.

#### **3.1.1 Corporate Identity and History**

Viverno GmbH is registered with the local court (Amtsgericht) of Munich under the commercial register number HRB 225948\.11 The company's registered address is Erlenstr. 8, D-82194 Gröbenzell, a municipality near Munich.2

The company's history shows a clear evolution from a smaller-scale entity to its current form. It was initially registered on May 28, 2016, as a "Viverno UG (haftungsbeschränkt)," a legal form in Germany often referred to as a "mini-GmbH" that allows for incorporation with a very low initial share capital. At its founding, the capital was listed as just €600.2 On January 12, 2018, the company underwent a significant transformation. Its legal form was changed to a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), and its share capital was increased to €25,000, the standard minimum for this more substantial corporate structure. At this time, the company's name was officially changed to Viverno GmbH.2 This progression from a UG to a GmbH is a common path for growing businesses in Germany and signals a phase of consolidation and increased capitalization for the venture.

#### **3.1.2 Leadership Transition**

The leadership of Viverno has seen a notable transition within the Butz family. The company was founded with Sibylle Mume (later documented as Sibylle Butz) as its managing director.2 She held this position from the company's inception as a UG in 2016 and through its transition to a GmbH. Public records show Sibylle Butz held the role of managing director until February 10, 2021\.11 On that date, a change in leadership was officially recorded: Niclas Butz was appointed as the new managing director, and Sibylle Butz was no longer in the role.2 This direct succession indicates a close relationship and a planned handover of executive control of the company. Other individuals, namely Jan Mittenzwei and Lars Sven Seidel, are also listed in one source as "verbundene Manager" (connected managers) of Viverno GmbH, though the precise nature and timeline of their connection are not detailed.14

#### **3.1.3 Business Purpose Analysis**

One of the most striking features of Viverno GmbH is the exceptionally broad and diverse business object (Gegenstand) listed in its official registration documents.2 The company's purpose is defined as encompassing production, trade, mediation, product development, and research, along with all related services and consulting, across a wide array of seemingly unrelated industries. These include:

* Cosmetics  
* Food and food supplements  
* The construction industry  
* Composite material manufacturing  
* The textile industry  
* Protective coatings and the paint industry  
* Analytical and university research purposes  
* Pharmaceuticals, medicine, fungicides, plant protection products, and repellents (with the specific caveat that these activities are permissible only if not subject to special approval).2

This is not the typical profile of a company focused on a single product or market. A company's stated business purpose is a legal declaration that defines the scope of its permissible activities. A narrow definition can be restrictive, while a broad one provides significant operational flexibility. The sheer breadth of Viverno GmbH's scope suggests that it is not structured as a conventional manufacturing or service company with a core competency. Instead, it appears to be designed as a strategic holding or development vehicle. This structure allows its leadership to pursue opportunities in various sectors without the administrative burden of establishing a new legal entity for each new venture. It points to an opportunistic and agile business strategy, focused on identifying and capitalizing on diverse market openings as they arise, rather than being committed to a single industry.

#### **3.1.4 Intellectual Property: The "HASC" Patent**

A tangible asset that provides insight into at least one of Viverno GmbH's specific areas of interest is a patent associated with the company. Patent application WO2018210360A1, filed in 2018, describes a "Method and device for producing highly pure aqueous pungent compositions (according to Scoville) (HASC) having a definable pungency, and products that can be produced therefrom".15 The patent details a sophisticated process for extracting pungent agents, such as capsaicin from vegetable matter, using high-pressure processes like supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The key innovation appears to be a method for making these naturally oil-soluble substances water-soluble by binding them with an emulsifier, creating an oil-in-water compound.15

This technology has potential applications in the food and beverage industry, where adding pungency to water-based products is a challenge. The patent's existence demonstrates a concrete R\&D focus within Viverno GmbH, aligning with the "food," "food supplements," and "research" clauses of its business purpose.

The patent document also introduces a term, the "Butz-Hoffer formula," which it claims can be used to define the necessary process parameters.15 An open-source search for this term could erroneously lead an analyst to the well-known "Hoffer Q" formula, a mathematical algorithm used in ophthalmology for calculating the power of intraocular lenses (IOLs) for cataract surgery.16 However, the contexts are entirely unrelated. The Hoffer Q formula is a product of decades of medical research by Dr. Kenneth J. Hoffer and is used in a clinical setting.16 The "Butz-Hoffer formula" mentioned in the Viverno patent, by contrast, pertains to the chemical engineering process of extracting capsaicin. It is almost certainly an internal neologism, likely named after the principals involved in its development (Butz and a potential, otherwise undocumented, collaborator named Hoffer). It has no connection to the established medical formula. Failing to make this distinction would be a significant analytical error, and it is crucial to clarify that the term in the patent is a unique, proprietary designation for Viverno's technology.

### **3.2 Feraplant S.A. (Luxembourg): A Study in Corporate Opacity**

In stark contrast to the detailed, albeit complex, public record of Viverno GmbH, Niclas Butz's other major corporate holding, Feraplant S.A., is characterized by a significant lack of publicly available information. This opacity is, in itself, a key data point.

#### **3.2.1 Known Information**

The public record confirms only a few basic facts about Feraplant S.A. Niclas Butz has served as its Chief Executive Officer since April 2016\.1 The company is a "Société Anonyme" (S.A.), which is a public limited company, and is registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.1 Beyond these facts, there is no readily available information on its business activities, financial performance, or other leadership personnel. A search for a corporate website or public-facing presence for Feraplant S.A. yielded no results within the provided materials.19

#### **3.2.2 The Luxembourg Advantage: Explaining the Information Gap**

The scarcity of information about Feraplant S.A. can be directly attributed to its legal form and jurisdiction. The Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register (Registre de commerce et des sociétés \- RCS) is the official database for companies in the country.9 While it provides public access to certain information, the disclosure requirements vary significantly based on the company's legal structure.

For a Société Anonyme (S.A.), while the initial articles of association filed upon incorporation are public documents, subsequent changes in shareholding do not need to be publicly registered.3 This means that while the founding shareholders might be identifiable by retrieving the initial deed, the current beneficial owners can remain private. This feature of Luxembourg corporate law makes the S.A. an attractive vehicle for holding companies, investment funds, and private asset management where shareholder privacy is a priority.

The decision to establish Feraplant S.A. as a Luxembourg-based S.A., rather than another German GmbH, is a strategic one. It suggests that the primary purpose of this entity is likely not operational or public-facing trade. Instead, its function is more probably related to holding assets, managing investments, or serving as a special purpose vehicle for specific financial transactions. The corporate structure itself points toward an intent to maintain a high degree of privacy and financial discretion.

### **3.3 MUC-FM (Munich): An Ambiguous Past Venture**

The earliest documented role in Niclas Butz's career history presents a notable ambiguity that cannot be definitively resolved with the available information.

#### **3.3.1 Documented Role**

According to his professional profiles, Niclas Butz was a "Co-Owner" of "MUC-FM" from July 2012 to August 2014\.1 The location is specified as Munich, Bavaria, Germany.1

#### **3.3.2 Identifying the Entity**

The designation "MUC-FM" is not a formal legal name and is open to multiple interpretations. "MUC" is the internationally recognized IATA airport code for Munich Airport, and "FM" is a common abbreviation for "Facility Management." A search for entities matching this description in Munich reveals several possibilities, none of which can be definitively linked to Mr. Butz based on the provided data.

Potential candidates include:

* **Flughafen München GmbH (FMG):** The official operator of Munich Airport. While the "MUC" connection is obvious, "FM" does not appear in its name, and it is a large public-private entity where a "Co-Owner" title would be unusual.21  
* **Facility Management Companies:** Several firms in Munich use "FM" and "MUC" in their branding or description. These include Müller & Partner GmbH, which has specialized in facility management in Munich since 1992 22, and Facility Management MUC UG, registered at the Munich court under HRB 254932\.7 However, the listed managing director for the latter is Andreas Feneberg, with no mention of Niclas Butz.7  
* **Real Estate and Development Firms:** Other entities like MUC Real Estate GmbH also operate in related fields in Munich.25

Without a specific commercial register number or the full legal name of the company, it is impossible to conclusively identify the "MUC-FM" where Mr. Butz was a co-owner. An expert report must acknowledge this uncertainty rather than making an unsubstantiated guess. The inability to clarify this early career entry highlights the limitations of open-source data and the importance of precise identifiers in corporate research.

## **Section 4: Engagement in Global Health and Non-Profit Sector**

A significant and more recent dimension of Niclas Butz's professional life is his high-level involvement with the Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx). This engagement places him within a global network of health experts, policymakers, and innovators, operating under the umbrella of the United Nations.

### **4.1 The Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx): Roles and Context**

#### **4.1.1 Dual Roles**

Mr. Butz holds two distinct but complementary roles at HIEx. His profile on The Org lists him as a Senior Advisor, a position he has held since December 2023\.1 Separately, his LinkedIn profile identifies him as an Ambassador for the organization.5 While the Senior Advisor role suggests a formal, perhaps technical or strategic, advisory function, the Ambassador title implies a role focused on representation, networking, and promoting the organization's mission to a wider audience. Together, these roles position him as a key figure with both internal influence and external representation responsibilities at HIEx.

#### **4.1.2 Organizational Mission**

To understand the significance of Mr. Butz's involvement, it is essential to understand the mission and structure of HIEx. The Health Innovation Exchange is not an independent NGO but rather a strategic initiative of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).1 It was officially launched in Geneva in May 2019, on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly, a high-profile gathering of global health leaders.1

The core mission of HIEx is to accelerate progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and other health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 It aims to achieve this by addressing a critical disconnect in the global health landscape: the gap between innovators who develop new health solutions and the implementers (such as governments and healthcare providers) who need those solutions on the ground. HIEx acts as a multilayered international platform and a broker, performing three key functions:

1. **Identifying Needs:** It works with implementers to identify and define pressing health challenges.  
2. **Connecting Innovators:** It connects these challenges with innovators and technologies that have a high potential for impact.  
3. **Linking Investors:** It facilitates connections with investors to help scale up promising innovations and develop sustainable solutions.1

HIEx operates from Geneva, Switzerland, and leverages the expertise of a wide range of actors, including countries, global health organizations, private sector innovators, and communities.1 Its parent organization, UNAIDS, has a broad mandate to lead global efforts towards ending the AIDS epidemic.1

Mr. Butz's dual roles as Senior Advisor and Ambassador place him directly at the nexus of these activities. This position provides a unique vantage point over the entire global health innovation ecosystem, from emerging health needs in developing countries to cutting-edge technologies being developed in the private sector and the flow of investment capital dedicated to health solutions.

This engagement in two seemingly disparate worlds—private, for-profit ventures and a UN-backed global health platform—is not necessarily a contradiction. On the contrary, it can be viewed as a highly synergistic strategy. His role at HIEx provides him with unparalleled, high-level intelligence on the most pressing global health needs, which can, in turn, inform market opportunities for commercial development. The challenges that HIEx identifies are essentially a map of future demand for health products and services.

Simultaneously, his position offers a prestigious and credible platform from which to promote or introduce innovations. The technologies developed or invested in through his private ventures, such as the HASC technology from Viverno GmbH with its potential applications in food supplements or pharmaceuticals, could be positioned as solutions to the very problems HIEx aims to solve. This creates a powerful feedback loop: the non-profit role provides access, credibility, and market intelligence, while the commercial ventures provide potential products and innovations that can be channeled back into the global health marketplace through the HIEx network. This represents a sophisticated model for a modern executive operating across public and private sectors, leveraging influence in one sphere to create opportunities in the other.

## **Section 5: Publicly Documented Network of Associates and Collaborators**

Mapping Niclas Butz's professional network requires a careful, tiered approach that distinguishes between verified business partners and more speculative, algorithmically-generated connections. The analysis below categorizes his associates based on the confidence level of the documented relationship.

### **5.1 Core Business & Management Associates (High Confidence)**

This category includes individuals with formally documented roles within Mr. Butz's primary corporate entity, Viverno GmbH. These connections are the most concrete and are substantiated by official or semi-official corporate data sources. They represent his closest circle of business collaborators.

**Table 5.1: Verified Business Associates**

| Name | Known Affiliation(s) | Nature of Connection to Niclas Butz | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sibylle Butz** | Viverno GmbH (formerly Viverno UG) | Founder and former Managing Director of Viverno. Served as Managing Director from its inception in 2016 until being succeeded by Niclas Butz on February 10, 2021\. Also documented under the name Sibylle Mume. | 2 |
| **Jan Mittenzwei** | Viverno GmbH | Listed as a "verbundene Manager" (connected manager) of Viverno GmbH in a database entry. The specific role or timeline of this connection is not detailed. | 14 |
| **Lars Sven Seidel** | Viverno GmbH | Listed as a "verbundene Manager" (connected manager) of Viverno GmbH in the same database entry as Jan Mittenzwei. The specific nature of this connection is also not detailed. | 14 |

The central figure in this core network is clearly Sibylle Butz, who founded and managed Viverno before Niclas Butz assumed leadership. The connection to Jan Mittenzwei and Lars Sven Seidel is less clear but is explicitly stated in at least one public data source, indicating a formal link to the company.

### **5.2 Event-Based Connections (Medium Confidence)**

This category includes individuals who are publicly listed alongside Niclas Butz in the context of a specific event. In this case, the data comes from a visitor or follower list for the Munich Security Conference (MSC), a high-profile international event.6 Attendance at such a forum does not confirm direct collaboration but indicates a shared sphere of interest, a certain level of professional access, and a significant networking opportunity. These connections are therefore considered to have a medium level of confidence as indicators of a professional network.

**Table 5.2: Associates from Event Attendance (Munich Security Conference)**

| Name | Known Affiliation(s) | Context of Connection | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Antonio Tijardovic** | Not specified | Listed as a visitor/follower on a page for the Munich Security Conference, alongside Niclas Butz. | 6 |
| **Tamar Millie Oz** | Business and Strategy Consulting, OTMS \- Oz Tailor Made Solutions | Listed as a visitor/follower on the same Munich Security Conference page. Her company, OTMS, is based in Israel. | 6 |

These connections suggest that Mr. Butz operates in circles concerned with international security, policy, and strategy, an environment where high-level business and political networking occurs.

### **5.3 Platform-Generated & Algorithmic Connections (Low Confidence)**

This category comprises individuals listed as "Related people" on professional networking platforms like The Org.1 It is crucial to approach this data with a high degree of caution. Such connections are often generated by algorithms based on shared keywords, industries, locations, or viewing history, rather than on any confirmed real-world relationship. Including them provides an exhaustive account of all data found, but they should not be considered verified associates without further corroborating evidence. The analyst's role is to present this data while simultaneously qualifying its reliability.

**Table 5.3: Unverified Algorithmic Connections (from The Org)**

| Name | Known Affiliation(s) | Platform | Note on Veracity | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Aysegul Ozdogan** | Women in Games | The Org | Algorithmic suggestion. No confirmed link to Niclas Butz has been established in the available data. | 1 |
| **Alex Naoumidis** | Gorgias | The Org | Algorithmic suggestion. No confirmed link to Niclas Butz has been established in the available data. | 1 |
| **Paarban Nath** | HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) | The Org | Algorithmic suggestion. No confirmed link to Niclas Butz has been established in the available data. | 1 |
| **Yixuan Min** | University of Bath | The Org | Algorithmic suggestion. No confirmed link to Niclas Butz has been established in the available data. | 1 |
| **Lili Siiskonen** | EDHEC Business School | The Org | Algorithmic suggestion. No confirmed link to Niclas Butz has been established in the available data. | 1 |

Presenting these unverified connections serves two purposes: it ensures the report is comprehensive by accounting for all names linked to Mr. Butz in the source material, and it educates the end-user on the critical need to differentiate between human-curated intelligence and raw, algorithmically-generated data.

## **Section 6: Synthesis and Avenues for Further Research**

### **6.1 The Profile of a Modern Executive**

The synthesis of the available data paints a portrait of Niclas Butz as a distinctly modern and strategic international executive. His professional identity is not defined by a single industry or role but by a dynamic interplay between different ventures and spheres of influence. He simultaneously manages opaque corporate structures like Feraplant S.A. in Luxembourg, which prioritize privacy and financial discretion, alongside a more operationally-focused (though still highly flexible) German company, Viverno GmbH, which is engaged in tangible R\&D and holds intellectual property.

This commercial portfolio is complemented by his high-profile engagement with the Health Innovation Exchange. This is not a tangential philanthropic activity but appears to be a core component of his professional strategy. The analysis strongly suggests a synergistic relationship between his commercial and non-profit activities. His role at HIEx provides him with a strategic vantage point on global health needs and access to a powerful network of decision-makers and investors. In turn, his commercial ventures are positioned to develop and capitalize on innovations that can be marketed as solutions within this very ecosystem. This dual-track approach—leveraging non-profit influence to inform and advance commercial objectives and vice-versa—is a sophisticated strategy characteristic of a new generation of globally-minded entrepreneurs who operate fluidly across public and private sector boundaries.

### **6.2 Key Relationships and Network Structure**

Mr. Butz's publicly documented network appears to be structured in concentric circles of influence and collaboration. At the core is a tight group of business associates directly involved in the management and history of Viverno GmbH, most notably Sibylle Butz. This inner circle represents the most verifiable and likely most significant set of professional relationships.

A broader circle is suggested by his attendance at high-level international forums like the Munich Security Conference. While the individuals identified in this context are not confirmed collaborators, their presence alongside him indicates a shared level of access and common interests in global policy and strategy. This points to a network that extends beyond his immediate business operations into the realms of international affairs.

The outermost circle consists of unverified, algorithmically-generated connections from online platforms. While these are the least reliable indicators of a relationship, they should not be dismissed entirely, as they may hint at shared digital communities or areas of interest that could warrant further investigation. Overall, his network appears intentionally curated, with a small, trusted core for business operations and a wider, more fluid network for intelligence gathering and influence.

### **6.3 Recommendations for Further Investigation**

To develop a more complete intelligence picture, several avenues for further research are recommended. These steps would require moving beyond open-source intelligence to more specialized and direct inquiries.

* **Feraplant S.A.:** The primary information gap surrounds this Luxembourg entity. It is recommended to commission a search from a specialized corporate intelligence firm based in Luxembourg. The objective would be to retrieve the full set of initial incorporation documents (articles of association) from the Luxembourg Business Registers (LBR). While these documents will not show subsequent shareholder changes, they are likely to identify the founding shareholders and initial directors, providing a crucial baseline of information about the company's origins and purpose.3  
* **MUC-FM:** The ambiguity of this past venture could potentially be resolved. A targeted search of the German Company Register (Unternehmensregister) should be conducted, specifically filtering for companies registered in Munich where Niclas Butz was listed as a director, partner, or significant shareholder during the 2012-2014 period.27 This may allow for the positive identification of the full legal name and registration number of the entity referred to as "MUC-FM."  
* **Viverno GmbH Network:** The nature of the connection for the "verbundene Manager," Jan Mittenzwei and Lars Sven Seidel, warrants further investigation.14 A deeper search of German corporate databases could clarify their specific roles, dates of involvement, and any other shared corporate affiliations with Niclas or Sibylle Butz, providing a more complete picture of the Viverno management team.

## **Appendix: Data Disambiguation and Exclusions**

A critical component of accurate intelligence analysis is the process of disambiguation—differentiating the subject from other individuals or entities with similar names—and the transparent exclusion of irrelevant information.

### **A.1 Disambiguation: Niclas Butz vs. Niklas Butz**

The research material revealed two distinct professionals with nearly identical names, operating in Germany. Failure to distinguish between them would corrupt the entire profile.

* **Niclas Butz (The Subject of this Report):**  
  * **Roles:** CEO of Feraplant S.A. and Viverno GmbH; Ambassador and Senior Advisor for Health Innovation Exchange (HIEx).1  
  * **Education:** Gymnasium Eggenberg im St. Anna Colleg; Nobel Algarve British International School.5  
  * **Location:** Based in Munich, Germany.1  
* **Niklas Butz (Unrelated Individual):**  
  * **Roles:** Project Engineer at Deutsche Lufthansa AG; Project Manager at House of Logistics and Mobility (HOLM) GmbH.4  
  * **Education:** Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from TU Berlin; Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Hochschule RheinMain.4  
  * **Location:** Based in Hanau, Germany.4

These are clearly two different individuals with distinct career paths and educational backgrounds. All information pertaining to Niklas Butz, the aerospace engineer, has been excluded from the main body of this report.

### **A.2 Disambiguation: The "Butz-Hoffer Formula"**

The patent held by Viverno GmbH (WO2018210360A1) refers to a "Butz-Hoffer formula" for its chemical extraction process.15 This term must be distinguished from the "Hoffer Q" formula, a well-established and widely published mathematical formula used in ophthalmology to calculate intraocular lens power for cataract surgery.16 The two are unrelated in function, origin, and field of application. The term in the Viverno patent is an internal neologism and should not be confused with the medical algorithm.

### **A.3 Disambiguation: Unrelated "Viverno" Entities**

Searches for "Viverno" yielded results for several other commercial entities with similar names. Based on their distinct business models and lack of any documented connection to Niclas Butz, these have been deemed unrelated and excluded from the analysis.

* **Viverano:** A brand of organic baby clothing.30  
* **Viverno (Forex):** An institutional liquidity broker for Forex and CFD investment services.32  
* **Vivenu:** A technology company providing ticketing solutions for live events.33

### **A.4 Excluded Search Results**

General searches using keywords such as "UNAIDS," "speaker," "conference," and "public records" in conjunction with the name "Butz" returned numerous results pertaining to other individuals. These included references to an A. Butz in UNAIDS-related academic papers 34, an Earl L. Butz who was a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture 36, a Nicholas Stasevich of the Butzel law firm 37, and a legal case involving a Nicholas David Butze.38 As none of these references pertain to the subject of this report, Niclas Butz, they have been excluded from the analysis.
