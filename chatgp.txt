## Hello Hugo!

This is my first post on my new Hugo website, generated by a cool script.

Isn't this exciting?

You can write your content in **Markdown**. It's easy and fun!

### Some features:
* Lists
* **Bold** and *italic* text
* Code blocks:

```python
# This is a Python code block
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Hugo User")
```

Check out the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for more.
