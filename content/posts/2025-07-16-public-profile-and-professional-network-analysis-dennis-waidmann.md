## **Executive Summary: Profile of Dennis Waidmann, Client Executive, Marsh Deutschland**

This report provides a comprehensive public profile of Dennis Waidmann, a Client Executive at Marsh Deutschland. The analysis confirms his identity as a senior professional in the German insurance and financial services sector, distinguishing him from other individuals with the same name. The subject has cultivated a sophisticated dual-track career, concurrently holding a corporate executive position at Marsh and an academic affiliation with the Faculty of Business at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.

His professional expertise is centered on insurance management, customer service, corporate finance, and financial risk management. These two roles—corporate practitioner and academic lecturer—are highly synergistic. His executive work at the world's largest insurance broker provides practical, current expertise for his teaching, while his academic position reinforces his status as a thought leader, a significant asset in high-value client advisory.

The subject's publicly documented professional network is most clearly defined within the academic sphere. He is verifiably associated with numerous colleagues at the DHBW Stuttgart Faculty of Business, particularly those with expertise in finance, accounting, and management. In contrast, his direct corporate network of colleagues, superiors, and subordinates at Marsh is not detailed in publicly available records, representing a notable gap in the open-source intelligence landscape. His overall public footprint is professional and controlled, consistent with that of a senior executive in a risk-sensitive industry.

## **Subject Identification and Disambiguation: Establishing a Verified Profile**

A foundational step in this analysis is the accurate identification of the subject, Dennis Waidmann. Public records contain multiple individuals with this name, necessitating a meticulous disambiguation process to ensure all subsequent information pertains exclusively to the Client Executive at Marsh Deutschland. The evidence confirms a clear distinction between the subject and at least one other prominent professional, as well as several other incidental name matches.

### **The Primary Subject: The Financial Professional (Marsh & DHBW)**

The subject of this report is identified through two congruent professional profiles. The initial anchor is a LinkedIn profile identifying Dennis Waidmann as a "Client Executive bei Marsh Deutschland" specializing in "Versicherungsmanagement, Kundenbetreuung" (Insurance Management, Customer Service) \[User Query\]. This corporate role is complemented by an academic profile on ResearchGate, which lists a Dennis Waidmann affiliated with the Faculty of Business at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.1

The connection between these two profiles is substantiated by several key factors:

1. **Alignment of Expertise:** The academic profile lists specialized disciplines in "Corporate Finance," "Finance," "Financial Risk Management," and "Financial Reporting".1 This expertise aligns perfectly with the responsibilities of a Client Executive at a leading global insurance brokerage and risk advisory firm like Marsh.  
2. **Geographic Proximity:** The academic affiliation is in Stuttgart.1 Marsh GmbH maintains a significant office in Stuttgart, located at Calwer Str. 7, 70173\.2 This shared geography provides a strong logistical link.  
3. **Institutional Model:** The DHBW is a "Duale Hochschule," or cooperative state university, a model that heavily integrates academic theory with practical work experience. A core feature of this system is the engagement of active industry practitioners as lecturers to provide students with current, real-world knowledge. The subject's dual role as a corporate executive and a faculty member fits this model precisely.

The confluence of specialized expertise, geographic location, and institutional structure provides a high degree of confidence that the Dennis Waidmann at Marsh Deutschland and the Dennis Waidmann at DHBW Stuttgart are the same individual.

### **The Excluded Subject: The Technical Sales Professional (Schrauben Jäger AG)**

A second, distinct professional profile exists for a Dennis Waidmann on the business networking platform XING.4 This individual is a "Vertriebsmitarbeiter im Außendienst" (Field Sales Representative) for Schrauben Jäger AG, a company specializing in industrial fasteners. His work territory covers the region from Pforzheim to Stuttgart and Rheinland Pfalz.4

This profile is definitively excluded from the subject of this report based on several irreconcilable differences:

1. **Divergent Industry and Role:** This individual operates in technical sales for an industrial supplier, a field entirely separate from the financial services and risk management sector where the primary subject works.  
2. **Incompatible Skill Set:** His listed skills include "Verkauf" (Sales), "Akquise" (Acquisition), and "Technischer Vertrieb" (Technical Sales).4 These competencies bear no resemblance to the financial and risk management expertise of the subject.  
3. **Contradictory Employment History:** The XING profile indicates a continuous, long-term employment with Schrauben Jäger AG since September 2002\.4 This extensive tenure in a single, distinct role makes a concurrent executive-level position at a multinational firm like Marsh highly improbable.

The existence of two separate, detailed, and long-standing professional profiles on different platforms (LinkedIn for the financial professional, XING for the sales professional) confirms they are two different individuals.

### **Other Discarded Mentions**

A comprehensive search revealed other incidental name matches, all of which have been excluded based on clear discrepancies:

* A "Den Waidmann" is listed as a co-author on a computer science paper related to machine learning. This is excluded due to the different first name and unrelated academic field.5  
* A "Waidmann S" is credited on a botany paper. This is excluded due to the different initial and unrelated scientific discipline.6  
* A "Waidmann M" is cited in a medical thesis. This is excluded due to the different initial and unrelated field.7  
* An anthropology professor named "Dennis Wiedman" is on the faculty at Florida International University. This is excluded due to the different spelling of the surname and a completely different profession and location.8

The following table summarizes the disambiguation process, clearly delineating the subject of this report from other individuals.

**Table 1: Disambiguation of 'Dennis Waidmann' Public Profiles**

| Profile Identifier | Associated Entity | Role/Title | Key Expertise/Field | Geographic Locus | Conclusion | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Subject** | Marsh Deutschland & DHBW Stuttgart | Client Executive / Faculty Member | Insurance, Financial Risk Management, Corporate Finance | Stuttgart, Germany | **Confirmed Subject** of this report. Profiles are congruent and synergistic. | User Query, 1 |

| Other Mention | arXiv.org Publication | Co-author | Computer Science, Machine Learning | Not Specified | **Excluded.** Different first name ("Den") and unrelated field. | 5 |
| Other Mention | OUCi Publication | Co-author | Botany, Plant Science | Not Specified | **Excluded.** Different initial ("S") and unrelated field. | 6 |

## **Professional Profile and Achievements**

Based on the verified identity, this section details the two primary facets of Dennis Waidmann's professional life: his corporate role at Marsh Deutschland and his academic affiliation with DHBW Stuttgart.

### **Corporate Role: Client Executive at Marsh Deutschland**

Dennis Waidmann holds the title of Client Executive at Marsh Deutschland, the German subsidiary of Marsh, which is a global leader in insurance broking and risk advisory.9 Marsh is a business of Marsh McLennan, a professional services firm with approximately 85,000 employees worldwide and over $20 billion in annual revenue.10 In Germany, Marsh GmbH employs between 700 and 900 people across a network of offices, including a key location in Stuttgart.2

The title "Client Executive" within a firm of Marsh's scale and sophistication denotes a senior, client-facing position. Individuals in this role are responsible for managing relationships with major corporate accounts. The subject's listed specializations in "Versicherungsmanagement" (Insurance Management) and "Kundenbetreuung" (Customer Service) confirm this focus \[User Query\]. His responsibilities would logically include:

* Developing a deep understanding of clients' business operations, strategic objectives, and risk exposures.  
* Designing, negotiating, and implementing complex, tailored insurance and risk financing programs.  
* Serving as the primary point of contact and strategic advisor for key clients.  
* Coordinating a wide range of internal resources—such as claims advocates, industry-specific specialists, and legal experts—to deliver comprehensive service.

Given the location of the Marsh office in Stuttgart and the economic profile of the Baden-Württemberg region, it is highly probable that his client portfolio includes companies in the automotive, advanced manufacturing, engineering, and technology sectors. While specific clients are not publicly documented, his professional environment is one of high-stakes, high-value corporate risk management.

### **Academic Affiliation: Faculty of Business, DHBW Stuttgart**

Concurrently with his corporate career, Dennis Waidmann is a member of the Faculty of Business at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.1 His listed disciplines on the university's research portal include "Corporate Finance," "Finance," "Financial Risk Management," and "Financial Reporting".1

The nature of his academic role is best understood through the DHBW's unique educational model. As a cooperative university, it partners with companies to provide an integrated program of academic study and paid work experience. This structure places a high value on faculty who are also active industry practitioners. Therefore, the subject's role is not that of a traditional, full-time research professor but rather an industry expert serving as a lecturer or adjunct faculty member. He brings his direct, day-to-day experience from Marsh into the classroom, teaching specialized courses grounded in current market realities.

This dual-track career creates a powerful professional identity. His executive work at Marsh provides him with a continuous stream of real-world case studies, emerging risk trends, and practical insights, which makes his teaching at DHBW exceptionally relevant and valuable to students. In turn, his academic affiliation lends him a significant degree of authority and credibility in his corporate role. It positions him to clients not merely as a broker or service provider, but as a recognized expert in financial risk. This synergy serves as a potent personal branding tool and is also strategically beneficial for Marsh, enhancing its reputation for thought leadership and creating a potential pipeline for identifying and recruiting emerging talent.

## **Analysis of Publicly Documented Network**

A primary objective of this report is to map the subject's publicly documented network of associates, collaborators, and professional peers. The available information allows for a detailed analysis of his academic network, while his corporate network remains less defined in the public domain.

### **The Academic Network: Colleagues at DHBW Stuttgart**

The most concrete and verifiable component of Dennis Waidmann's professional network is his list of colleagues at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg Stuttgart. A public list of faculty members provides the names and disciplines of his peers, particularly within his own department, the Faculty of Business.13 These individuals are his professional associates in an academic context, with whom he would likely interact in faculty meetings, curriculum planning, and other institutional functions.

This network can be stratified to assess the likely strength and nature of these connections:

#### **Tier 1: Associates with Direct Disciplinary Overlap**

The most significant professional relationships within this network are likely with colleagues whose academic disciplines directly align with the subject's expertise in finance and risk. These individuals share a common professional language and focus, making them probable collaborators for co-teaching, course development, or informal professional consultation. Key associates in this tier include:

* **Philip Mantz:** His listed disciplines are "Finance," "Accounting," and "Management Accounting."  
* **Katharina Maihöfer:** Her disciplines are "Financial Analysis," "Finance," and "Banking and Finance."  
* **Johannes Jehle:** His disciplines are "Accounting," "Finance," and "Financial Accounting."

#### **Tier 2: Broader Faculty of Business Colleagues**

The subject is also associated with a wider group of peers within the Faculty of Business whose specializations are in related but distinct management areas. These connections represent a broader professional circle within the same academic department. This group includes:

* **Charlotte Armbruster** (Management, Marketing Management)  
* **Theresa Knoll** (Management, Leadership, Strategic Analysis)  
* **Tommy Eberwein** (Business, Management, Strategic Management)  
* **Maximilian Riehl** (Machine Learning, Computer Vision) \- This connection is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a potential cross-disciplinary link to the growing fields of FinTech and InsurTech, which are increasingly relevant to the subject's corporate work.  
* Other listed members of the Faculty of Business include: **Justin Kater, Fabian Eulitz, David Meßmer, Nathalie Dziemba, Svenja Bäzner, Robin Kluftinger, Ioannis Sismanidis, Ludwig Groeber,** and **Fabian Lang**.

The following table provides a structured overview of this identified academic network.

**Table 2: Identified Associates at DHBW Stuttgart (Faculty of Business)**

| Name | Department | Stated Disciplines/Expertise | Potential Relationship to Subject | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Philip Mantz | Faculty of Business | Finance, Accounting, Management Accounting | Direct Disciplinary Peer | 13 |
| Katharina Maihöfer | Faculty of Business | Financial Analysis, Finance, Banking and Finance | Direct Disciplinary Peer | 13 |
| Johannes Jehle | Faculty of Business | Accounting, Finance, Financial Accounting | Direct Disciplinary Peer | 13 |

### **The Corporate Network: Marsh Deutschland (Inferred)**

In stark contrast to his academic circle, the subject's direct corporate network at Marsh is opaque in publicly available information. The provided source materials do not name any of his direct colleagues, superiors, or subordinates within the Marsh Stuttgart office or his specific practice group. This represents a critical and significant information gap.

While some Marsh employees are named in public records—such as **Marco Quast** (Practice Leader, Film & Entertainment) and **Stefan Thomsen** (Senior Account Representative, Film & Entertainment)—they are based in the Hamburg office and operate in a completely different specialty.2 There is no documented connection between them and Dennis Waidmann.

Although specific individuals cannot be named, it is possible to describe the structure of the network inherent to his role as a Client Executive. This network would consist of:

* **Internal Connections:** He operates within a team structure. This includes a direct reporting line to a Practice Leader or Managing Director within the Stuttgart office or a national practice group. He would collaborate daily with other Client Executives, junior Account Representatives or Client Advisors who provide support, and specialists from various departments (e.g., claims, legal, analytics, underwriting).  
* **External Connections:** The most critical component of his professional network is his portfolio of corporate clients. These relationships, built on trust and advisory, are his primary focus and a key asset. However, due to client confidentiality, this network is not and would not be publicly documented.

In summary, while his academic network is well-documented, his most immediate and impactful professional network—his day-to-day corporate team and his client base—remains private.

## **Comprehensive Public Footprint and Concluding Analysis**

### **Synthesis of Findings**

The analysis of publicly available information paints a clear picture of Dennis Waidmann as a highly specialized and strategically positioned professional in the German insurance and risk management landscape. He has successfully constructed a dual-track career that leverages the strengths of both the corporate and academic worlds. This creates a synergistic professional brand that positions him as a practitioner-expert: his senior executive role at a global industry leader is validated by his academic standing, and his teaching is grounded in elite, real-world practice. His public network is most visible and verifiable within the academic community of DHBW Stuttgart, where he is connected to a faculty of business and finance experts. His direct corporate network at Marsh, however, is not visible in the public record.

### **Analysis of Digital Footprint**

The subject's digital footprint is professional, focused, and controlled. His presence is effectively bifurcated between a corporate-facing platform (LinkedIn) and an academic one (ResearchGate). This deliberate separation aligns with his dual career tracks. There is a notable absence of a more personal public footprint, such as active public social media profiles on platforms like Twitter or Facebook, or personal blogs. This controlled information environment suggests a conscious effort to separate his professional and private life, a common and prudent practice for senior executives operating in risk-sensitive and client-confidential industries like high-end financial services and insurance.

### **Concluding Insights and Implications**

Dennis Waidmann exemplifies the "practitioner-expert" archetype, a professional model that is exceptionally effective in advisory fields. He is not simply a Client Executive who executes transactions; he is positioned as a thought leader whose expertise is validated through a formal academic affiliation. This construction of a professional identity is a powerful strategic asset. For his corporate clients, he is not just a representative of Marsh but an authority on financial risk who also teaches the subject at the university level. For his students, he is not an abstract academic but a leader from the forefront of the industry, offering tangible and current insights.

This carefully cultivated dual identity is a mechanism for building trust and authority, which are the essential currencies in the high-end insurance and risk advisory business. It allows him to engage with clients on a more strategic level, moving the relationship beyond a simple service provision to one of trusted counsel. While the specifics of his client relationships and internal team at Marsh remain confidential, his public profile is unambiguously that of a credible, authoritative, and well-connected expert operating at a sophisticated level within the German financial services ecosystem.
