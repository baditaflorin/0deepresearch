      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At 0DeepResearch, we believe meaningful connections start with genuine understanding. We're building a collaborative knowledge commons where thorough research on people, organizations, and ideas becomes a shared resource that doesn't disappear after a single use.</p>

      <h2>The Vibe Briefing Concept</h2>
      <p>Born from professional necessity, the Vibe Briefing is our signature approach: a 10-minute micro-research sprint that reveals who someone is, what they've achieved, and where your interests might align. This pre-meeting ritual transforms networking from transactional exchanges to meaningful connections by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating immediate rapport through knowledge of shared interests</li>
        <li>Identifying potential collaboration opportunities before your first conversation</li>
        <li>Demonstrating genuine respect by acknowledging someone's journey and work</li>
        <li>Saving time by bypassing surface-level introductions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our founder developed the prompt that powers these briefings: "Research [PERSON'S FULL NAME] and compile a concise public profile: basic bio, notable achievements, and—most importantly—a list of publicly documented associates, collaborators, and friends (any context, not limited to professional work), with brief notes and sources for each connection."</p>

      <h2>Why We Built This Platform</h2>
      <p>Every day, professionals around the world conduct similar research, scraping the web for insights on potential collaborators, clients, and partners. Yet this valuable work vanishes after serving its immediate purpose.</p>

      <p>0DeepResearch preserves and shares this collective intelligence, creating:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A growing repository of deeply researched profiles</li>
        <li>Analyses of organizations, movements, and concepts</li>
        <li>Technical insights and methodological approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
      <p>Our platform supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Professionals seeking more meaningful business relationships</li>
        <li>Researchers looking for comprehensive starting points</li>
        <li>Networkers who value depth over breadth</li>
        <li>Anyone who believes relationships matter more than transactions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Contribute</h2>
      <p>0DeepResearch is a collaborative effort. We welcome contributions of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original research profiles on individuals, companies, or organizations</li>
        <li>Deep dives into movements, concepts, or phenomena</li>
        <li>Technical guides and methodologies for effective research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To contribute, contact us through our GitHub repository.</p>

      <h2>Our Standards</h2>
      <p>While we value comprehensive research, we respect privacy boundaries. All content on 0DeepResearch:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses only publicly available information</li>
        <li>Focuses on professional achievements and public associations</li>
        <li>Avoids speculation and unverified claims</li>
        <li>Includes proper attribution and sources</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Join us in building a community where depth matters and connections are built on understanding rather than chance.</p>
