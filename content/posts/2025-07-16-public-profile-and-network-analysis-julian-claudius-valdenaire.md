## **Part I: Executive Profile: Julian Claudius Valdenaire**

### **1.1. Executive Summary**

Julian Claudius Valdenaire is a German serial entrepreneur and executive with a distinguished two-decade career primarily focused on the telecommunications industry. His professional trajectory is characterized by a highly effective "build-to-sell" strategy, executed in a consistent and symbiotic partnership with his twin brother, Tobias Valdenaire. Together, they founded, scaled, and successfully exited two major telecommunications companies, eteleon AG and Tarifhaus AG, selling them to industry giants Drillisch AG and Telefónica, respectively. This repeated success established their reputation as astute venture builders capable of identifying and capitalizing on consumer-facing market opportunities through technology-driven platforms.

Mr. Valdenaire's expertise lies in the operational and technical dimensions of e-commerce, specifically in software development, logistics, and the analysis of complex business models. His career demonstrates a pattern of creating lean, expert-led ventures designed for rapid growth and strategic acquisition.

In 2020, Mr. Valdenaire executed a significant strategic pivot, co-founding IMMO.info gemeinnützige GmbH, a non-profit organization dedicated to consumer education in the real estate and finance sectors. This move marks a departure from his for-profit endeavors and suggests a new focus on social entrepreneurship and legacy-building. He now applies his proven skills in creating user-friendly online tools and platforms to a new mission: demystifying complex financial decisions for homeowners. This evolution from a pure-play capitalist to a consumer advocate represents a new chapter in his career, leveraging the success of the past to address a distinct societal need.

### **1.2. Core Competencies & Educational Foundation**

Julian Valdenaire's professional capabilities are rooted in a combination of formal business education and extensive hands-on experience in building technology-centric companies. His public profile on the professional network XING highlights a specific set of skills that have been central to his ventures, including the development of "innovative und preisführende Mobilfunkprodukte" (innovative and price-leading mobile products), expertise in "Corporate Venture Capital," and a deep understanding of "Internet- und E-Commerce-Dienstleistungen" (Internet and E-Commerce services).1

This self-assessment is corroborated by his defined role within his past leadership teams. At the founding of Tarifhaus AG, his responsibilities were explicitly centered on "Software, IT- und Logistikprozesse, Kooperationen" (Software, IT and logistics processes, cooperations).2 This delineation points to his function as the chief architect of the operational and technological backbone of his companies, complementing his brother's focus on sales and marketing.

His entrepreneurial career is built upon a strong academic foundation. Mr. Valdenaire holds the title of *Diplom-Kaufmann* (abbreviated as Dipl.-Kfm.), a graduate degree in business administration from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in Munich, one of Germany's leading universities.1 The

*Diplom-Kaufmann* is a traditional German academic degree that required intensive, university-level study and is widely considered equivalent to a Master of Science in Business Administration or an MBA.3 This rigorous education provided him with the comprehensive theoretical framework in economics, finance, and management that has underpinned his subsequent business ventures.

## **Part II: The Telecommunications Magnate: Two Decades of Market Disruption**

### **2.1. The Eteleon Era (2000-2015): From Startup to Strategic Acquisition**

Julian Valdenaire's career as a major force in the German telecommunications market began in mid-2000 with the founding of eteleon GmbH. He launched the venture alongside his twin brother, Tobias Valdenaire, and a third partner, Werner Freytag.7 The company, which was later restructured into the holding company eteleon e-solutions AG, pioneered the internet-based marketing of mobile phone contracts.7 This e-commerce model was disruptive at the time, moving the sales process from physical stores to online platforms. The company's strategy involved collaborations with nearly all network operators and handset manufacturers, and it leveraged a vast network of approximately 6,000 affiliate partners, including major web portals like freenet.de and web.de, to drive sales.7

The company's innovative model fueled dynamic growth, culminating in a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2006, which brought the company to the public market.9 This trajectory eventually attracted the attention of a larger industry player. In 2009, Drillisch AG acquired a majority stake in eteleon, marking the successful completion of the Valdenaire brothers' first major "build-to-sell" cycle.14

Following the acquisition, Julian and Tobias Valdenaire were not merely absorbed but were elevated to key executive positions within the Drillisch group, a testament to the value Drillisch placed on their expertise. They were appointed as *Konzernbereichsvorstände* (Group Division Directors), with Julian taking responsibility for Offline Sales and Marketing and Tobias for the Online division.9 During this period, Julian also held leadership roles in various Drillisch subsidiaries, serving as a board member (

*Vorstand*) of yourfone AG and managing director (*Geschäftsführer*) of Mobile Ventures GmbH, the corporate venture arm of Drillisch.1

After six years within the Drillisch corporate structure and 15 years after founding eteleon, the brothers made a calculated decision to depart. In October 2015, it was announced that they would not be renewing their board contracts "on their own wish," with the stated intention of pursuing self-employment once again in 2016\.14 This was not a termination but a strategic exit, clearing the way for their next major entrepreneurial venture.

### **2.2. The Tarifhaus Venture (2016-2019): A Refined "Build-to-Sell" Playbook**

Free from their obligations at Drillisch, the Valdenaire brothers immediately applied their proven formula to a new venture. In 2016, they founded Tarifhaus AG, this time partnering with Staffan Schilke, a *Diplom-Volkswirt* (graduate in economics).2 The founding team demonstrated a clear and complementary division of labor from the outset: Julian focused on technology and operations, Tobias led sales and marketing, and Staffan Schilke managed finance, HR, and customer service.2

The venture was established with a sophisticated corporate structure, comprising the parent company Tarifhaus AG (a stock corporation) and several operating subsidiaries, including Tarifhaus Online GmbH, Tarifhaus CLUB GmbH, and Tarifhaus Services GmbH.8 This multi-entity setup provided operational flexibility and was well-suited for a potential modular acquisition by a future buyer.

The company experienced what was described as "rasantes Wachstum" (rapid growth), quickly establishing itself as a significant player in the market.18 This rapid scaling once again attracted the interest of a major network operator. In 2019, just three years after its founding, Tarifhaus AG was acquired by Telefónica (o2), one of Germany's largest telecommunications providers.18 This second successful exit in a decade cemented the Valdenaire brothers' reputation as masters of the "build-to-sell" model. Following the acquisition, the operational entities of the venture were systematically wound down. In a clear demonstration of the trust within the core team, co-founder Staffan Schilke was appointed as the official liquidator for Tarifhaus CLUB GmbH and Tarifhaus Online GmbH in May 2023, tasked with overseeing their formal dissolution.8

### **2.3. The "Valdenaire Brothers" Strategic Pattern**

An analysis of Julian Valdenaire's two-decade career in telecommunications reveals a distinct and deliberately repeated strategic pattern. The successes of eteleon AG and Tarifhaus AG were not isolated events but rather two iterations of a finely tuned playbook for value creation and strategic sale. The career of Julian Valdenaire, inseparable from that of his brother Tobias, is a case study in building ventures specifically as acquisition targets for larger industry players.

The first step in this pattern involved identifying a consumer-facing complexity or inefficiency in the German mobile market that could be solved with a user-friendly, technology-driven platform. For eteleon, it was the shift of contract sales to the internet.7 For Tarifhaus, it was the creation of new, transparent tariff structures.

The second step was the formation of a lean, highly specialized founding team. The core of this team was always the Valdenaire brothers, whose complementary skills in technology/operations (Julian) and sales/marketing (Tobias) formed a powerful engine for growth.2 This core was augmented by a third key partner with specific domain expertise: Werner Freytag in the initial eteleon venture and the economist Staffan Schilke for the more financially sophisticated Tarifhaus setup.2

The third step was the execution phase: building the company for rapid scaling and market penetration. This involved creating robust e-commerce platforms and establishing key partnerships to quickly acquire a substantial customer base, making the company an attractive target.

The final and definitive step was the strategic exit. Eteleon was sold to Drillisch AG, a major service provider looking to bolster its online presence.14 Tarifhaus was sold to Telefónica, a network operator seeking innovative tariff models and direct market access.18 In both cases, the ventures were sold to established industry giants for whom the acquisition represented a strategic enhancement of their own business.

This repeatable model demonstrates that Julian Valdenaire is not an operator who intends to run a company for its entire lifecycle. He is a venture strategist who conceives, builds, and scales businesses as assets designed for acquisition. This predictability makes him and his core team a potentially attractive partner for venture capital or private equity investors who prioritize a clear path to a profitable exit. Any future for-profit venture he might undertake would likely follow this same meticulously crafted and proven playbook.

## **Part III: A New Direction: Real Estate Advocacy and the Non-Profit Model (2020-Present)**

### **3.1. The Founding of IMMO.info gemeinnützige GmbH**

Following the successful sale of Tarifhaus AG, Julian Valdenaire embarked on the most significant strategic pivot of his career. In August 2020, he and his brother Tobias registered IMMO.info gemeinnützige GmbH, a non-profit limited liability company, with the Munich commercial register under the number HRB 258727\.12 This move signaled a deliberate shift away from the for-profit, high-stakes telecommunications sector into the realm of social entrepreneurship.

The stated corporate purpose of IMMO.info is the promotion of charitable goals through consumer advice and education in the real estate and finance sectors, delivered primarily through a free and independent internet portal.12 The organization's non-profit status was officially recognized by the Munich tax authority on February 3, 2021, under the German tax code provision for promoting consumer advice (§ 52 Abs. 2 Satz 1 Nr. 16 AO).18

The portal explicitly states that it does not sell or broker any financial or real estate products and that no contractual relationship is formed between the user and the company.13 Its mission is purely educational, focusing on providing high-quality, in-depth guides, online calculators, and transparent comparisons of complex financial products for homeowners. The content particularly targets the needs of seniors navigating decisions around property life annuities (

*Leibrente*), partial sales (*Teilverkauf*), equity release, and other models for accessing home equity while retaining the right to reside in the property.18

### **3.2. Julian Valdenaire's Role and the Core Team**

As co-founder and managing director (*Geschäftsführer*) of IMMO.info, Julian Valdenaire is, along with his brother Tobias, directly responsible for the content and strategic direction of the platform.13 His specific editorial focus within the organization is on "Online-Tools und Rechner, Immobilienverrentung, Mieten oder Kaufen, Anbieter und Geschäftsmodelle" (Online tools and calculators, property life annuity, renting or buying, providers and business models).21 This role leverages his established expertise in software processes, logistics, and the deconstruction of complex business models, applying it to a new subject matter.

The formation of the IMMO.info team underscores the durability of Valdenaire's professional network. The venture is not only led by him and his brother Tobias but also involves a key figure from their very first venture. Werner Freytag, the co-founder of eteleon back in 2000, is listed as an "Experte für Internetportal und Online-Rechner" (Expert for internet portal and online calculators) for IMMO.info.21 The reappearance of Freytag two decades after their first collaboration is a powerful indicator of the long-term professional bonds and mutual respect that characterize Valdenaire's inner circle.

### **3.3. The Pivot to a "Legacy" Venture**

The creation of IMMO.info represents a fundamental evolution in Julian Valdenaire's career strategy, moving from value creation for profit to value creation for public good. This is not a random foray into a new field but a calculated application of his core competencies to an area of personal interest and societal need. The company's website notes that he and his brother have been private real estate investors for over a decade, with a focus on developing and renting residential properties.18 This pivot is therefore an extension of their existing knowledge base into a non-profit framework.

After achieving significant financial success from two major corporate exits, the motivation appears to have shifted from wealth accumulation to legacy building. The chosen field—real estate finance for seniors—is notoriously complex, often opaque, and involves some of the most significant and emotionally charged financial decisions in a person's life. A non-profit entity is uniquely positioned to provide the trusted, independent guidance that is often lacking in this market.

The skillset is eminently transferable. The process of building an online portal that simplifies complex financial instruments with calculators and business model comparisons is directly analogous to building e-commerce platforms that simplified complex mobile tariffs. Valdenaire is redeploying his proven technical and analytical capabilities in a new domain.

This venture can be interpreted as a "legacy project." It allows him to leverage his capital and expertise to address a clear social need, establishing a reputation as a trusted consumer advocate and building a durable, respected institution. This strategic move into the "trust economy" fundamentally recasts his public profile, adding the dimension of a social entrepreneur to that of the successful capitalist. It is a strategic evolution that could yield significant reputational and networking benefits in philanthropic and public policy circles.

## **Part IV: Comprehensive Network Analysis: Documented Associates and Collaborators**

A defining feature of Julian Valdenaire's career is his reliance on a small, durable, and highly trusted network of partners and collaborators. The analysis of his professional history reveals a clear distinction between an inner circle of co-founders and a wider circle of executive colleagues who joined for specific ventures.

### **4.1. The Inner Circle: Enduring Partnerships**

**Tobias Valdenaire**

* **Relationship Type:** Brother (Family), Co-Founder, and continuous Business Partner.  
* **Association Context:** Tobias Valdenaire is the most significant and constant figure in Julian Valdenaire's professional life. Public records and media identify them as brothers, and they have been photographed together at social events.22 Their business partnership is a symbiotic entity that spans the entirety of their documented careers. They co-founded eteleon AG in 2000 7, were appointed as joint Group Division Directors at Drillisch AG 9, co-founded Tarifhaus AG in 2016 2, and are the co-founders and managing directors of their current non-profit venture, IMMO.info gGmbH.12 They are also co-managing directors of their personal investment vehicles, Valdenaire GmbH and Valdenaire VV GmbH.8 Their professional roles are consistently complementary, with Julian managing the technical and operational aspects while Tobias leads sales, marketing, and legal matters.2  
* **Sources:**.2

**Staffan Schilke**

* **Relationship Type:** Co-Founder and trusted Business Partner.  
* **Association Context:** Staffan Schilke formed the third part of the core founding team for the Tarifhaus venture. As a *Diplom-Volkswirt* (graduate in economics), he provided essential expertise in finance, personnel, and customer operations, rounding out the founding team's skillset.2 He served as a member of the executive board of Tarifhaus AG and as a managing director of its key subsidiary GmbHs, always in concert with the Valdenaire brothers.8 The depth of trust placed in him is most evident in his role after the sale to Telefónica. He was appointed as the sole liquidator for Tarifhaus CLUB GmbH and Tarifhaus Online GmbH in 2023, a position that requires the utmost integrity and reliability to manage the final financial and legal dissolution of the corporate entities.8  
* **Sources:**.2

**Werner Freytag**

* **Relationship Type:** Co-Founder (eteleon) and long-term Expert Collaborator (IMMO.info).  
* **Association Context:** The relationship with Werner Freytag is a testament to the longevity of Julian Valdenaire's professional network. Freytag was one of the three original founders of eteleon in 2000, instrumental in the company's initial success.7 Two decades after that initial collaboration, and long after the Drillisch acquisition, Freytag has reappeared as a key contributor to the Valdenaires' latest project. He is credited as an "Experte für Internetportal und Online-Rechner" (Expert for internet portal and online calculators) at IMMO.info.21 This enduring professional bond, spanning multiple decades and entirely different ventures, highlights a core network built on sustained mutual respect and proven competence.  
* **Sources:**.7

### **4.2. Executive Colleagues and Corporate Officers**

Beyond the inner circle, Julian Valdenaire has worked alongside numerous executives and directors in specific corporate contexts.

* **Claus Jepp:** Succeeded the founding team (J. Valdenaire, T. Valdenaire, S. Schilke) on the executive board of Tarifhaus AG in November 2019, a move that likely occurred post-acquisition by Telefónica.8  
* **Erwin Hämmerle:** Served as a managing director at Tarifhaus Online GmbH for a period in 2018, after which the founding partners resumed the roles in 2019\.8  
* **Holger Woltersdorf:** Appointed managing director of From Home GmbH in March 2020\. This company was the successor entity to Tarifhaus Services GmbH, and Woltersdorf took over the role from Julian and Tobias Valdenaire.8  
* **Florian Jung & Dieter Pohlmann:** Served as fellow board members (*CxO*) with Julian Valdenaire at yourfone AG during his tenure there in the second half of 2015\.8  
* **Verena Lacher:** Was the managing director of Neo Eventservice GmbH immediately prior to Julian Valdenaire taking over the position in May 2022\.8  
* **Stefan Wende:** Succeeded Julian Valdenaire as the managing director of Neo Eventservice GmbH in April 2023\.8  
* **Heiko Hambückers:** Took over from Julian Valdenaire as managing director of yourfone Shop GmbH (which was later renamed aptus-Shop für Telekommunikation und Zubehör GmbH).11  
* **André Driesen & Torsten Hauschildt:** Were fellow managing directors at Mobile Ventures GmbH, the Drillisch venture capital arm, during the time Julian Valdenaire led the entity.10

### **4.3. Publicly Documented Social Acquaintances**

**Bruce Reith**

* **Relationship Type:** Social Acquaintance.  
* **Association Context:** The only publicly documented non-business association for Julian Valdenaire is a photograph taken with Bruce Reith. They were pictured together at the Käferschänke beer tent at Theresienwiese during Oktoberfest in Munich on October 2, 2019\.

## **Part V: Conclusion: The Strategist's Evolution**

The public profile of Julian Claudius Valdenaire is best understood as a career in two distinct but connected acts. Act One established him as a formidable and highly successful profit-driven entrepreneur in the German telecommunications industry. Together with his brother Tobias, he authored and perfected a strategic playbook for value creation: identify a market gap, build a technology-driven solution, scale rapidly, and execute a profitable sale to a major industry player. The successful exits of eteleon AG to Drillisch and Tarifhaus AG to Telefónica are the defining achievements of this era, marking him as a master of the "build-to-sell" venture model.

Act Two, which began in 2020, presents the evolution of the strategist into a social entrepreneur. With the founding of the non-profit IMMO.info, Mr. Valdenaire has pivoted from pursuing market share to pursuing a social mission. He is now applying the capital, experience, and skills honed in his first act to a new purpose: empowering consumers in the complex and often intimidating real estate finance market. This is not a retirement but a redeployment of his strategic and technical acumen into the "trust economy," building a legacy centered on public service rather than private profit.

Across both acts, several core themes remain constant. First is the unwavering reliance on a small, trusted inner circle of collaborators, most notably his brother Tobias Valdenaire, but also including long-term partners like Werner Freytag and Staffan Schilke. Second is a deep-seated belief in the power of technology to simplify complex consumer products and decisions, whether they be mobile tariffs or reverse mortgages. Finally, each venture, for-profit or non-profit, is characterized by a clear and meticulously executed strategic vision. While his market focus and ultimate goals have evolved, Julian Valdenaire's fundamental approach to building and scaling ventures remains consistent, making him a subject of continued and significant interest for observers of both the technology and social enterprise sectors in Germany.
