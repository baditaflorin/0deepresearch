# **Evaluating Collaborative Self-Hostable Video Conferencing Platforms: A Comprehensive Analysis**

**Executive Summary**

The demand for secure, controllable, and customizable communication solutions has propelled self-hostable video conferencing platforms to the forefront for many organizations. This report provides an in-depth evaluation of ten distinct platforms: Jitsi Meet, Nextcloud Talk, BigBlueButton, Rocket.Chat (leveraging integrations), Element Call, Apache OpenMeetings, MiroTalk SFU, Galène, PlugNMeet, and Wire. Each platform is assessed against thirty criteria, covering technical specifications, server requirements, core and advanced collaboration features, security protocols, extensibility, and operational aspects.

Key findings reveal a diverse landscape. Platforms like Jitsi Meet and BigBlueButton offer robust, feature-rich environments, with Jitsi Meet being a versatile, general-purpose tool and BigBlueButton excelling in educational contexts due to its pedagogical features. Nextcloud Talk and Rocket.Chat provide strong collaborative ecosystems, with their video conferencing capabilities often relying on or enhanced by integrations with specialized services like Jitsi or BigBlueButton. This highlights a critical consideration: the distinction between native and integrated video features, which impacts deployment complexity and feature dependency.

Security remains a paramount concern, with platforms such as Element Call, Wire, and Jitsi Meet offering varying degrees of end-to-end encryption (E2EE). However, the implementation of E2EE can affect server-side functionalities like recording and transcription. Scalability also varies significantly, with some platforms designed for smaller groups and others, particularly those utilizing Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) like LiveKit (Element Call, PlugNMeet) or robust backends (Nextcloud Talk with HPB, Jitsi with JVB), capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of participants. This scalability often comes with increased server resource demands and deployment complexity, presenting a fundamental trade-off for organizations.

The open-source nature of these platforms offers significant advantages in terms of customization and cost, but the specifics of licensing (MIT, Apache, AGPL, etc.) and the availability of commercial support or enterprise editions introduce nuances. Docker availability is widespread, simplifying deployment for many, but server requirements can range from modest for platforms like Galène to substantial for production-grade BigBlueButton or Jitsi Meet installations.

Ultimately, the "best" platform is contingent upon an organization's specific requirements, technical capabilities, budget, and security posture. This report aims to equip decision-makers with the detailed comparative data necessary to navigate these considerations and select the most appropriate self-hosted video conferencing solution. A recurring theme is the need to balance desired features against the operational commitment of self-hosting, underscoring the importance of thorough internal assessment and pilot testing before full-scale deployment.

**I. Introduction to Self-Hosted Video Conferencing**

The Imperative for Control and Privacy  
In an era where digital collaboration is central to operations across industries, the choice of communication tools has profound implications for data security, operational autonomy, and financial outlay. While cloud-based SaaS video conferencing solutions offer convenience, a growing number of organizations are recognizing the imperative for greater control and privacy, leading them to explore self-hostable alternatives. The motivations are compelling: self-hosting provides unparalleled data sovereignty, ensuring that sensitive conversations and shared information reside on an organization's own infrastructure, or on trusted, privately managed servers. This mitigates risks associated with third-party data handling and potential breaches.  
Beyond security, self-hosted platforms offer significant advantages in terms of customization. Access to source code, particularly with open-source solutions, allows organizations to tailor the platform to their specific workflows, integrate it with existing enterprise systems, and modify features to meet unique needs.1 This level of adaptability is rarely achievable with proprietary SaaS offerings. Furthermore, self-hosting can be more cost-effective in the long run, especially for organizations with consistent, high-volume usage, by eliminating recurring subscription fees.1 While initial setup and maintenance require technical resources, the total cost of ownership can be lower, and it avoids vendor lock-in, providing greater strategic flexibility. The active communities often surrounding open-source projects also offer valuable support and continuous enhancements.1

Report Objectives and Scope  
This report aims to provide a detailed, comparative evaluation of ten prominent self-hostable video conferencing platforms. The objective is to equip technically proficient individuals and teams with the necessary information to make an informed decision when selecting a solution that aligns with their specific requirements for collaboration, security, scalability, and operational management.  
The scope of this analysis encompasses thirty distinct criteria for each platform, covering:

* Core technical details and licensing information.  
* Server hardware and software prerequisites.  
* Performance characteristics, including participant capacity and video resolution.  
* Essential and advanced collaborative features such as screen sharing, chat, file transfer, whiteboarding, recording, and breakout rooms.  
* Security measures, including end-to-end encryption and authentication mechanisms.  
* Extensibility through APIs, webhooks, and integrations.  
* Operational aspects like custom branding, community activity, and release frequency.

It is important to note that this evaluation is based exclusively on the research material provided at the time of this report's compilation.

Methodology  
The platforms included in this report were selected based on their explicit self-hosting capabilities and their mention within the provided research documents, ensuring relevance to the user's query. Data for each of the thirty evaluation criteria were meticulously extracted from these documents. Where information was not available, this has been clearly indicated in the analysis. The gathered data was then compiled into individual platform profiles and a comprehensive comparative analysis to identify key differentiators, strengths, and weaknesses.  
Emerging Consideration: The Trade-off Landscape  
A significant consideration that emerges from analyzing self-hostable video conferencing platforms is the inherent trade-off between the richness and scalability of features, and the complexity and resource demands associated with self-hosting. Platforms that offer an extensive suite of functionalities, support for a large number of concurrent participants, and high video resolutions often necessitate more substantial server resources and a higher degree of technical expertise for successful deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. For instance, Jitsi Meet, while highly scalable, can become complex to manage for very large deployments 2, and BigBlueButton's production environments have considerable server requirements.3  
Conversely, platforms designed with simplicity and moderate resource consumption in mind, such as Galène 4, may be easier to set up and manage but might offer a more streamlined feature set or have different scalability profiles for highly interactive, large-scale meetings. This does not represent a deficiency in either type of platform but rather reflects a fundamental choice in the self-hosting paradigm. Organizations must carefully weigh their specific feature requirements and desired scale of operation against their internal technical capabilities and infrastructure budget. This balance will be a recurring theme throughout the platform evaluations and comparative analysis, guiding users toward a solution that best fits their unique context.

**II. Key Evaluation Criteria for Collaborative Platforms**

To provide a structured and comprehensive comparison, the ten selected self-hostable video conferencing platforms are evaluated against thirty specific criteria. These criteria are grouped thematically below to offer a logical framework for understanding the various dimensions of each platform.

* **Release Frequency (per year):** The rate at which new versions or updates are released, indicating active maintenance and development.

A critical aspect that often becomes apparent when evaluating these criteria is the interdependency of features. For example, robust recording capabilities, such as those offered by Jitsi Meet through its Jibri component 2 or Nextcloud Talk's dedicated recording backend 27, invariably influence server resource planning and storage strategies. Similarly, the implementation of end-to-end encryption 1 can introduce complexities or limitations for server-side processing tasks like recording or live transcription, unless specific architectural approaches (e.g., client-side recording or E2EE that selectively excludes a recording bot) are employed.

Furthermore, platforms like Rocket.Chat often provide video conferencing by integrating with specialized services such as Jitsi Meet or BigBlueButton.9 In such cases, many video-specific features are inherited from, and dependent on, the capabilities of the integrated platform. This layered approach offers flexibility but also means that evaluating the video conferencing aspect of Rocket.Chat necessitates an understanding of the underlying service it employs. Consequently, a simple affirmative or negative for a feature may not fully capture its operational implications; the report will endeavor to highlight these interdependencies where the provided information allows.

**E. Element Call**

* **Profile:**  
  * **Introduction:** Element Call is a native Matrix video conferencing application developed by Element. It is designed for secure, scalable, privacy-respecting, and decentralized video and voice calls operating over the Matrix protocol.29 It utilizes MatrixRTC (MSC4143) and leverages LiveKit as its backend for SFU capabilities, enabling support for large meetings.29 Element Call can function as a standalone web application or be embedded as a widget within Matrix clients like Element Web or Element X.29  
  * **Open Source Status & Licensing:** Yes, Element Call is open source. It is dual-licensed: available for free under the AGPL-3.0 license, or via a paid Element Commercial License for users who require different terms.29  
* **Detailed Features:**  
  * **Self-Hosted Option (Y/N):** Yes, Element Call can be self-hosted. This involves deploying the Element Call web application and its backend components, including a Matrix homeserver (like Synapse), a LiveKit SFU, and a Matrix LiveKit JWT authentication service.29  
  * **Docker Image Available (Y/N):** Yes, Docker is mentioned for deploying backend components in a local development environment (Synapse, LiveKit Auth Service, LiveKit SFU, Redis) via dev-backend-docker-compose.yml.29 For the Element Web client (which can host Element Call as a widget), official Docker images like vectorim/element-web and community alternatives like dotwee/element-web are available.115  
  * **Minimum Server Requirements:** Self-hosting Element Call requires a Matrix homeserver (e.g., Synapse), a LiveKit SFU, and a LiveKit JWT auth service.110 For Synapse with open federation, Element recommends a minimum of 8 vCPUs and 32GB RAM; for closed federation, 6 vCPUs and 16GB RAM.117 The Element Call application itself (static files) has minimal requirements, but the backend (especially LiveKit SFU) will depend on usage. LiveKit server resource needs are not detailed in these snippets for specific user counts.  
  * **Max Concurrent Participants:** Dependent on the self-hosted LiveKit SFU's capacity. LiveKit itself states no hard limit on participants per room for its core architecture, but practical limits depend on server resources and configuration.118 LiveKit Cloud free tier limits to 100 concurrent participants, Ship plan to 1,000, and Scale plan is unlimited.119 For a self-hosted LiveKit SFU, this would need to be determined by server capabilities.  
  * **Video Resolution Support:** Not explicitly detailed for Element Call, but LiveKit (its backend) supports various codecs and resolutions, and the quality would be adaptable based on network conditions and client capabilities.  
  * **Screen Sharing (Y/N):** Yes, Element Call supports screen sharing.111 LiveKit, its backend, has native screen sharing support across platforms.121  
  * **Recording Capability (Y/N):** Dependent on the LiveKit backend. LiveKit supports recording audio and/or video using its Egress feature, which can create room composite recordings.118  
  * **Recording Storage:** If using LiveKit's Egress for recording, files can be stored in cloud storage providers like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.122  
  * **End-to-End Encryption (Y/N):** Yes, Element Call provides end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls.29  
  * **Live Chat (Y/N):** Element Call itself is primarily for voice/video. Chat functionality is part of the broader Matrix ecosystem provided by clients like Element X or Element Web, which can embed Element Call as a widget. Element X offers rich messaging features.124 The focus of Element Call is the call itself, with chat being handled by the hosting Matrix client.  
  * **File Transfer (Y/N):** Similar to chat, file transfer is a feature of the hosting Matrix client (e.g., Element Web/X), not directly of Element Call. Matrix supports file sharing.  
  * **Whiteboard / Annotation Tools (Y/N):** Not specified as a feature of Element Call in the provided snippets.  
  * **Breakout Rooms (Y/N):** Not specified as a feature of Element Call in the provided snippets.  
  * **Live Transcription (Y/N):** Not specified for Element Call itself. LiveKit (backend) can make text transcripts available in real-time via its llm\_node or transcription\_node for agent sessions.122  
  * **Transcript Export Formats:** If using LiveKit's text transcript features, it can be saved to a file (e.g., JSON).122  
  * **Bot / App Framework (Y/N):** Not directly for Element Call, but the Matrix ecosystem supports bots and integrations.  
  * **API Access (Y/N):** When used as a widget, Element Call communicates with the hosting client via the widget API.29 The LiveKit backend has its own server APIs for token generation, room management, etc..118  
  * **Webhook Support (Y/N):** LiveKit (the backend) supports webhooks for server events.118  
  * **Authentication Methods:** In widget mode, authentication is handled by the hosting Matrix client.29 For standalone mode, it connects to a homeserver, implying Matrix authentication. The LiveKit backend uses JWT tokens for authorizing clients to connect to the SFU.29  
  * **User Roles & Permissions (Y/N):** Managed by the Matrix homeserver and room permissions within the Matrix ecosystem. Element X allows admins to kick/ban users.124 LiveKit tokens can encode permissions for what a participant can do in a LiveKit room.118  
  * **Moderation / Mute Controls (Y/N):** These would typically be features of the call interface. Element X allows admins to take actions on users.124 Specific in-call moderation controls for Element Call are not detailed, but standard WebRTC call controls (mute/unmute) are expected.  
  * **Integrations:** Element Call integrates as a widget into Matrix clients like Element Web and Element X.29 It relies on a Matrix homeserver and LiveKit backend.  
  * **Custom Branding (Y/N):** Not specified for Element Call itself. However, since it's open source and can be self-hosted, customization of the web interface is possible. The hosting Element client (like Element Web) might also have its own theming options.125  
  * **Community Activity Score:** High for Element and Matrix. Element Call (element-hq/element-call) has 699 stars and 113 forks.29 The broader Element and Matrix projects have very active communities.  
  * **Release Frequency (per year):** The element-hq/element-call repository shows frequent commits and releases. The latest version mentioned is v0.11.1 on May 19, 2025\.29 Element X (iOS client) also sees frequent updates, e.g., v25.05.2 on May 26, 2025 and v25.04.3 on Apr 14, 2025 124, indicating an active development ecosystem.

**F. Apache OpenMeetings**

* **Profile:**  
  * **Introduction:** Apache OpenMeetings is an open-source web conferencing solution that provides video conferencing, instant messaging, whiteboarding, collaborative document editing, and other groupware tools.127 It uses API functions from a media server, Kurento (previously Red5), for remoting and streaming.127 It is designed to be a flexible platform for online meetings, training, and webinars.128  
  * **Open Source Status & Licensing:** Yes, Apache OpenMeetings is an open-source project under The Apache Software Foundation.131 It is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.129

  * **Recording Capability (Y/N):** Yes, entire sessions including audio/video can be recorded.128  
  * **Recording Storage:** Recordings can be downloaded as MP4 files or watched online. They are managed in an integrated File-Explorer.130 FFmpeg is required for importing/converting recorded files.133  
  * **End-to-End Encryption (Y/N):** Some sources suggest OpenMeetings offers E2EE.142 However, the primary OpenMeetings documentation details data security through HTTPS/SSL and secure protocols like RTMPS 129, but does not explicitly describe a client-to-client E2EE mechanism for media streams in the same way modern E2EE systems (like Signal protocol based) are defined. The underlying Pulsar project (unrelated to OpenMeetings media server but an Apache project) has E2EE for messages 143, which might cause confusion. The core OpenMeetings documentation focuses on transport encryption.  
  * **Live Chat (Y/N):** Yes, instant messaging and multi-whiteboard chat are available.127  
  * **File Transfer (Y/N):** Yes, through the File Explorer in each room. Users have private and public drives, and files can be exchanged.129 Maximum upload size is configurable (default 100MB).139  
  * **Whiteboard / Annotation Tools (Y/N):** Yes, extensive multi-whiteboard capabilities with drawing, writing, image import, document import (PDF, DOC, PPT), and collaborative editing.127  
  * **Breakout Rooms (Y/N):** The main feature list on the Apache OpenMeetings website does not explicitly mention "breakout rooms" in the same way other platforms do.131 While it supports multiple room types (presentation, cooperation, interview) 145 and user/group management for assigning users to different rooms, dedicated in-meeting dynamic breakout room functionality as seen in tools like Zoom or BigBlueButton is not clearly detailed in these snippets. OpenTalk, which is sometimes mentioned in similar contexts, does have breakout rooms 146, but this is a distinct product.  
  * **Live Transcription (Y/N):** Not explicitly mentioned as a native feature in the core documentation.129 One unrelated YouTube video shows an AI service transcribing meeting audio from object storage, but this is not presented as a built-in OpenMeetings feature.147  
  * **Transcript Export Formats:** Not applicable if live transcription is not a native feature.  
  * **Bot / App Framework (Y/N):** Not explicitly mentioned as a bot framework, but it offers SOAP/REST APIs for integration.129  
  * **API Access (Y/N):** Yes, SOAP/REST APIs are provided for integration with other applications and websites.129  
  * **Webhook Support (Y/N):** Not specified in the provided snippets.  
  * **Authentication Methods:** Supports internal user management, LDAP/ADS connectors, and OAuth2.130 Configuration options exist for allow.frontend.register, allow.soap.register, allow.oauth.register.139  
  * **User Roles & Permissions (Y/N):** Yes, a moderating system allows moderators to adjust user permissions individually during a conference (e.g., allow/deny moderation, drawing, presenting, screen sharing, mute).128 User and group management is available in administration.130  
  * **Moderation / Mute Controls (Y/N):** Yes, extensive moderation controls are provided.128  
  * **Integrations:** Plugins for Moodle, Sakai, Jira, Joomla, Drupal, Bitrix, Confluence, SugarCRM, Redmine.129 LDAP/ADS and VoIP/Asterisk integration modules are also available.129  
  * **Custom Branding (Y/N):** Yes, the logo in the header can be changed by replacing image files and modifying configuration XMLs. The application name displayed in text labels and browser titles can also be customized.130  
  * **Community Activity Score:** Moderate. The apache/openmeetings GitHub repository has 1.1k stars, 728 forks, and 25 contributors.127  
  * **Release Frequency (per year):** Moderate. Major releases occur roughly every two years (e.g., 7.0.0 in Feb 2023, 8.0.0 in Jan 2025). Minor releases (2-3) typically follow within the first year of a major release.152 The latest version is 8.0.0.127

**G. MiroTalk SFU**

* **Profile:**  
  * **Introduction:** MiroTalk SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) is a free, open-source, self-hostable WebRTC video conferencing platform built on Mediasoup.155 It emphasizes simplicity, security, and scalability, supporting high video resolutions (up to 4K or even 8K mentioned in some contexts) and compatibility across all major browsers and platforms without requiring downloads or plugins.155

  * **User Roles & Permissions (Y/N):** The first participant to join a room automatically becomes the presenter/moderator by default, but this can be configured. Presenters have access to moderation options.164 Host protection implies an admin/host role.  
  * **Moderation / Mute Controls (Y/N):** Yes, the presenter/moderator has moderation options available in settings and via participant controls in chat.164  
  * **Integrations:** Slack, Discord, and Mattermost integrations are mentioned for enhanced communication. Sentry for error reporting.155  
  * **Custom Branding (Y/N):** Possible with a Regular or Extended commercial license, which allows rebranding by changing logo, name, description, etc..161 The AGPLv3 license would require modifications to be shared. UI themes are customizable.155  
  * **Community Activity Score:** Moderate. The miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu GitHub repository has 2.3k stars and 357 forks.171 A Discord server is available for community questions and support.155 The Cloudron forum also shows some user discussions.164  
  * **Release Frequency (per year):** The GitHub repository shows 2,139 commits with the latest activity being recent.158 Specific release versions and their dates are not as clearly listed as in dedicated "Releases" pages of other projects in the snippets, but Cloudron lists MiroTalk SFU version 1.8.39.159 This suggests ongoing development.

**B. Discussion of Key Differentiators**

The master table reveals a varied landscape. While many platforms offer core functionalities like screen sharing and chat, significant differences emerge in areas like security, scalability, deployment complexity, and the richness of advanced collaboration tools.

* Security Posture:  
  End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a critical differentiator. Jitsi Meet 10, Element Call (via Matrix and LiveKit) 29, Wire 197, and PlugNMeet 182 explicitly state support for E2EE for media streams. Nextcloud Talk also offers E2EE for calls.52 BigBlueButton is mentioned as providing E2EE in some comparisons 78, though its primary security often revolves around transport layer security and robust access controls. Apache OpenMeetings and Galène focus more on transport encryption (TLS/DTLS-SRTP), with the server having access to media streams.5 MiroTalk SFU uses DTLS-SRTP where the self-hosted SFU decrypts/re-encrypts media.163 The implementation details of E2EE are crucial; for example, Jitsi Meet offers it by default with advanced settings 35, while for others, it might be a configurable option or inherent to their architecture (like Matrix for Element Call). It's vital to understand that enabling E2EE can impact server-side functionalities like recording or transcription, as the server cannot process encrypted media without specific E2EE-compatible mechanisms.  
  Authentication methods are diverse. Most platforms support internal user databases. Enterprise-grade authentication like LDAP and SAML is common in platforms like Nextcloud Talk (via Nextcloud platform) 53, BigBlueButton (via Greenlight/Keycloak) 91, Rocket.Chat 105, and Wire.197 JWT-based authentication is prominent in Jitsi Meet 18 and Element Call (for LiveKit access) 29, facilitating secure embedding and API interactions.  
  User roles and moderation controls are generally available, allowing hosts to manage meetings effectively. Platforms like BigBlueButton 93 and Apache OpenMeetings 130 offer granular in-meeting permission adjustments. Jitsi Meet provides moderator capabilities like muting, kicking, and room locking.22  
* Scalability and Performance:  
  Maximum concurrent participant numbers vary widely. Jitsi Meet is often cited for around 100 participants on a reasonably configured server but can scale much higher with multiple Jitsi Videobridges (JVBs) and Octo for federation.2 BigBlueButton can handle 200-500 users per server, extendable with Scalelite.72 Wire supports up to 150 E2EE participants.197 Nextcloud Talk's capacity is modest without its High-Performance Backend (HPB) (2-10 users) but scales to thousands with it.52 Platforms leveraging LiveKit, such as Element Call and PlugNMeet, inherit LiveKit's scalability, which can be substantial (hundreds to thousands, depending on the LiveKit server setup).119 Galène is designed for moderate loads, efficient for lectures (300/core) but smaller for interactive meetings (20-
