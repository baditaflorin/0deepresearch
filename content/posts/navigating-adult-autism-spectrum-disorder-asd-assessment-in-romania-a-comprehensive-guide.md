**Navigating Adult Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Assessment in Romania: A Comprehensive Guide**

**1. Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder in Adulthood**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.1 These characteristics typically begin in early childhood and can influence an individual's ability to function in various societal contexts, including socially, in education, and in the workplace.1 For adults who suspect they may be on the autism spectrum, or for those seeking to understand a loved one, gaining clarity on what ASD entails is a critical first step.

- **1.1. Defining ASD and Asperger's Syndrome: Current Perspectives**

The term "Asperger's syndrome," historically used to describe individuals often considered to be at the milder end of the autism spectrum, is still in use by some people.1 However, current medical understanding, as reflected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), has integrated Asperger's syndrome into the broader category of Autism Spectrum Disorder.3 ASD is now the comprehensive term for a wide range of presentations, and healthcare providers might refer to what was formerly known as Asperger's syndrome as "ASD – without intellectual or language impairment".3

This shift from distinct subtypes to a single spectrum reflects a more nuanced understanding of autism's diverse manifestations. Clinicians found it challenging to rigidly categorize symptoms, particularly as difficulties in communication and social interaction are often interrelated.4 The current spectrum approach acknowledges the significant variability in how autistic traits are expressed and experienced by different individuals. This evolution in diagnostic conceptualization is particularly important for adults seeking assessment, as their presentation of traits can be complex and may not fit neatly into outdated stereotypes or narrowly defined categories. It underscores that the diagnostic process itself has evolved to focus on the presence and severity of core characteristics across a continuum.

- **1.2. Common Characteristics and Manifestations in Adults**

While ASD originates in early development, with signs such as reduced eye contact or lack of response to one's name sometimes observable within the first year of life, its manifestations in adulthood can be varied.1 Adults on the autism spectrum often experience persistent challenges in social communication and interaction across multiple settings.2 These can include:

\* Difficulties with social-emotional reciprocity, such as initiating or responding to social interactions, or sharing emotions.5

\* Challenges with nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, such as abnormalities in eye contact and body language, difficulties understanding and using gestures, or a limited range of facial expressions.5

\* Difficulties in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, which may range from adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts to an apparent absence of interest in peers.5

Alongside social communication differences, adults with ASD may exhibit restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These can include 2:

\* Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech.

\* Insistence on sameness, an inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior, often accompanied by distress at small changes.

\* Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus.

\* Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).3

Intellectual ability in autistic individuals can range from significantly impaired to average or above average. Some individuals may learn quickly yet encounter difficulties in communicating, applying their knowledge in everyday life, and adjusting to social situations.1 Specific examples of how these characteristics might manifest include trouble starting or sustaining conversations (unless it is to make requests or label items), speaking with an atypical tone or rhythm (e.g., a singsong voice or robot-like speech), repeating words or phrases verbatim without necessarily understanding their contextual use (echolalia), and a literal interpretation of language, leading to difficulties with idioms, humor, or sarcasm.1 Recognizing subtle nonverbal cues like facial expressions or tone of voice in others can also be challenging.1

It is important to recognize that many core ASD traits, especially those related to social communication and interaction, can be misinterpreted by others as intentional rudeness, disinterest, or eccentricity, particularly in undiagnosed adults. Experiences shared by individuals highlight instances of being misunderstood or even bullied as a result of these differences.7 If these behaviors are not understood as part of a neurodevelopmental difference, they are likely to be judged negatively against neurotypical societal standards, potentially leading to social isolation and contributing to mental health challenges, such as anxiety or depression. An adult diagnosis can be pivotal in reframing these past social difficulties, not as personal failings, but as manifestations of ASD, which can be crucial for self-acceptance and for effectively communicating one's needs to others.9

Furthermore, characteristics such as an "insistence on sameness" or "highly restricted, fixated interests" 5 can present as both a challenge and a strength. While these traits can sometimes interfere with daily life if they become overly obsessive or lead to significant distress when routines are disrupted 3, they can also be sources of profound comfort, predictability, and deep expertise. Focused interests can translate into specialized skills and knowledge that are highly valuable in particular academic fields or professions. Post-diagnostic support should therefore consider how to manage the challenging aspects of these traits while also leveraging their potential as strengths.

- **1.3. Overview of Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5 and ICD-11)**

A formal diagnosis of ASD should be based on the criteria outlined in either the DSM-5, published by the American Psychiatric Association, or the ICD-11, published by the World Health Organization.2 Both manuals identify similar core characteristics necessary for a diagnosis: persistent differences in social communication and social interaction, and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, which include sensory sensitivities.2

According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder include 2:

\* Criterion A: Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts. This is manifested by deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and skills in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships.

\* Criterion B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following: stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech; insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior; highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus; hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment.

\* Criterion C: Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).

\* Criterion D: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.

\* Criterion E: These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay.

\* The DSM-5 also includes specifiers to describe the diagnosis more precisely, such as whether it is with or without accompanying intellectual impairment, with or without accompanying language impairment, associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor, or associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder.

The ICD-11 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder are broadly similar 2:

\* Persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions that are outside the expected range of typical functioning given the individual’s age and level of intellectual development.

\* Persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and sociocultural context. This includes atypical responses to sensory stimuli.11

\* The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood.

\* The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

\* ICD-11 also allows for differentiation of ASD with or without a disorder of intellectual development and with or without mild or no impairment of functional language.4 A notable feature of ICD-11 is its recognition that for some individuals, distress, impairment, and overt social challenges may only become apparent once societal demands increase, for example, during adolescence or adulthood.11

A common point of concern for adults seeking diagnosis can be the criterion that symptoms must originate in the early developmental period. Many adults may not have clear memories or formal records from their early childhood. However, it is understood by clinicians that while the underlying neurodevelopmental differences must have been present early on, the functional impairment associated with these differences may not become fully apparent or problematic until later in life.4 This can occur when social or occupational demands increase beyond an individual's coping capacities, or when "camouflaging" (masking autistic traits to fit in) becomes too exhausting to maintain. Therefore, adults seeking assessment should be prepared to discuss their early development to the best of their ability, understanding that clinicians experienced in adult ASD are aware of these complexities and that a lack of detailed childhood records does not necessarily preclude a diagnosis. The diagnostic process for adults often involves a careful retrospective account of childhood experiences and developmental trajectory.

**2. The Diagnostic Pathway in Romania: Professionals and Processes**

Navigating the path to an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis as an adult in Romania involves understanding the roles of different healthcare professionals, the general assessment procedures, and the tools that may be utilized. The system can present challenges, but clarity on these aspects can empower individuals seeking assessment.

- **2.1. Key Professionals Involved**

Several types of professionals may be involved in the ASD diagnostic pathway for adults in Romania, each with distinct roles.





\*   \*\*2.1.1. The Role of the Psychiatrist in Formal Diagnosis\*\*
    In Romania, a \*\*psychiatrist\*\* is the medical professional who can provide a formal diagnosis of autism in adults.[12] They are also authorized to prescribe medication if needed, for ASD-related symptoms or co-occurring conditions.[12] Personal accounts from individuals in Romania confirm that diagnoses are often received from psychiatrists.[7, 13]
    The psychiatrist's role is not limited to the diagnostic act itself. They are often involved in managing co-occurring mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which are frequently experienced by autistic individuals.[5, 14] This comprehensive approach can be beneficial. However, the effectiveness of this relies on the psychiatrist having specialized knowledge of adult ASD and how it may interact with or be differentiated from other conditions. There can be a risk of "diagnostic overshadowing," where ASD traits are misattributed to another known condition (e.g., anxiety, personality disorder), or vice-versa, if the clinician lacks specific expertise in adult autism. Furthermore, psychiatrists have expressed concerns about systemic issues such as lengthy waiting lists for diagnostic services and chronically under-resourced mental health services in general, which can impede timely support and diagnosis.[14]

\*   \*\*2.1.2. The Role of the Clinical Psychologist in Assessment and Support\*\*
    \*\*Clinical psychologists\*\* in Romania play a significant role in the assessment process and in providing therapeutic support, although they generally do not issue the formal ASD diagnosis themselves; this responsibility typically lies with the psychiatrist.[12] Psychologists are trained to administer a variety of psychological tests and assessments that can evaluate cognitive abilities, adaptive functioning, behavioral patterns, and specific ASD traits.[15, 16, 17] For instance, some clinics list adult psychological evaluations for autism among their services.[15]
    While psychiatrists provide the formal diagnostic label, the detailed psycho-educational assessment often conducted by psychologists is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of an individual's unique profile of strengths and challenges. This detailed information is invaluable for informing tailored therapeutic interventions and support strategies post-diagnosis. Psychologists also provide various forms of psychotherapy to help individuals manage ASD-related challenges and improve their quality of life.[12]
    However, a challenge highlighted in personal accounts is that some psychologists in Romania may have limited knowledge or experience with autism in adults.[7, 13] Therefore, finding a clinical psychologist with specific expertise in adult ASD is important for a thorough and accurate assessment and for effective therapeutic support. Ideally, a collaborative approach between a knowledgeable psychologist and a psychiatrist can lead to the most comprehensive diagnostic outcome and support plan.

\*   \*\*2.1.3. When a Neurologist Might Be Consulted\*\*
    A \*\*neurologist\*\*, who specializes in disorders of the nervous system, is not typically the primary professional for diagnosing ASD.[18] That role, as mentioned, usually falls to psychiatrists (for adults) or developmental pediatricians and child psychologists (for children). However, a neurologist can play a valuable consultative role in the diagnostic process for adults under certain circumstances.[18]
    Referral to a neurologist may occur if there are concerns about co-occurring neurological conditions, such as epilepsy (which has a higher prevalence in autistic individuals), or if there are specific neurological signs or symptoms that need further investigation to rule out other conditions that might mimic or co-exist with ASD.[18, 19] For example, if an individual presents with intellectual disability alongside suspected autistic traits, or if there are signs pointing towards a possible genetic syndrome with neurological implications, a neurological and/or medical genetics consultation may be recommended as part of the comprehensive diagnostic workup in Romania.[19] Neurologists may conduct neurological examinations and, if indicated, arrange for brain imaging studies, not to diagnose ASD itself (as ASD is diagnosed based on behavioral criteria), but to assess overall brain function and exclude other potential causes for the observed symptoms.[18] This involvement underscores the potential complexity of adult diagnosis, where a thorough approach may be needed to consider all relevant medical factors.

\*\*Table 1: Comparing Roles: Psychiatrist vs. Psychologist in Adult ASD Diagnosis in Romania\*\*



| **Feature** | **Psychiatrist** | **Clinical Psychologist** |
| **Formal Diagnosis Authority** | Yes, can provide a formal ASD diagnosis for adults in Romania.12 | Generally, no; supports the diagnostic process but the formal diagnosis is typically made by a psychiatrist.12 |
| **Primary Assessment Focus** | Clinical interview, medical history, differential diagnosis (ruling out/identifying other medical/psychiatric conditions), symptom severity. | Detailed psychological testing (cognitive, adaptive behavior, personality, ASD-specific measures), behavioral observations, developmental history.15 |
| **Use of Standardized Tools** | May use screening questionnaires, clinical rating scales; relies on DSM-5/ICD-11 criteria. | Administers and interprets a range of standardized psychological tests and ASD-specific assessment tools (e.g., ADOS, ADI-R components, questionnaires).16 |
| **Psychotherapy Provision** | May offer some forms of counseling or psychoeducation; some may have additional psychotherapy training. | Primary provider of various forms of psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, skills training, supportive therapy) tailored to ASD needs.12 |
| **Medication Prescription** | Yes, can prescribe medication for ASD-related symptoms or co-occurring conditions (e.g., anxiety, ADHD).12 | No, cannot prescribe medication. |
| **Typical Referral Pathway Involvement** | Often the final point for diagnostic confirmation. May receive referrals from GPs or psychologists. | May receive referrals from GPs or psychiatrists for detailed assessment or therapy. May refer to a psychiatrist for diagnostic confirmation or medication. |

- **2.2. The General Assessment Process for Adults**

The process of obtaining an ASD diagnosis as an adult can be intricate. Clinicians in Romania acknowledge that diagnosis can be difficult, particularly as diagnostic criteria have evolved and there has been a noted lack of screening tools specifically validated for the adult Romanian population.20 A formal diagnosis should adhere to the criteria set forth in the DSM-5 or ICD-11.2

A comprehensive assessment for adult ASD typically involves multiple components. This may include a detailed review of the individual's medical and developmental history, a physical examination, and an assessment of neurological function, although neuroimaging is not a standard procedure for diagnosing ASD itself but rather for ruling out other conditions.18 The core of the evaluation often involves 22:

\* In-depth clinical interviews with the adult to gather information about current challenges and past experiences.

\* Observation of the individual's behavior and communication style during the assessment.

\* Where possible and with the individual's consent, interviews with family members (e.g., parents, spouse) to gather collateral information about early development and current functioning.

\* Assessment of cognitive abilities (e.g., intellectual functioning, executive functions) and language skills.

\* Evaluation of adaptive functioning skills (i.e., practical, everyday skills needed for independent living).

\* Use of standardized questionnaires and rating scales completed by the adult and/or informants.

A crucial aspect of adult ASD assessment is the exploration of early developmental history, as ASD is, by definition, a neurodevelopmental condition with an onset in early childhood.22 This can be challenging for adults who may have limited recall of their early years or lack access to parental reports. Clinicians experienced in adult ASD are generally aware of this and employ strategies to reconstruct a developmental picture, understanding that many autistic adults have developed sophisticated "camouflaging" or coping mechanisms over the years that may have masked their traits earlier in life. The lack of validated adult-specific screening tools for the Romanian population further complicates this, meaning clinicians may need to rely more heavily on internationally recognized tools, their clinical judgment, and a thorough exploration of the individual's lifelong experiences. Adults seeking diagnosis should therefore be prepared for a comprehensive, and potentially lengthy, evaluation process.

- **2.3. Standardized Diagnostic Tools and Their Use in Romania**

A variety of standardized tools may be used as part of an adult ASD assessment in Romania. The availability and use of these tools can vary between public and private settings and among different clinicians.





\*   \*\*"Gold Standard" Observational and Interview Tools:\*\*
    \*   The \*\*Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)\*\* is a semi-structured, standardized assessment of communication, social interaction, play, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. It involves direct observation of the individual by a trained clinician. ADOS-2 has modules appropriate for assessing verbally fluent adults and is considered a gold-standard instrument. It has been translated and is available for use in Romania.[16, 23]
    \*   The \*\*Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R)\*\* is a comprehensive, structured interview conducted with a parent or caregiver who is familiar with the individual's developmental history and current behavior. It is also considered a gold-standard tool and is translated and available in Romania.[23] While primarily designed for use with informants, its questions about developmental history are highly relevant for adult diagnosis.

\*   \*\*Questionnaires and Screening Tools:\*\*
    \*   The \*\*Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)\*\* is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure autistic traits in adults. The AQ and the \*\*Empathy Quotient (EQ)\*\* have been part of research aiming to validate them for the Romanian general population, with the Romanian version of the AQ showing slightly lower internal consistency compared to the original validation study.[20, 21] These are components of the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA).[2]
    \*   The \*\*Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale – Revised (RAADS-R)\*\* is another self-report questionnaire designed to identify autistic traits in adults, particularly those who may "camouflage" their traits.[2] An online version, described as adapted and translated using AI, is available on at least one Romanian psychologist's website, though it is emphasized as a preliminary screening tool that does not replace a full professional consultation.[24]
    \*   The \*\*AQ-10\*\* is a brief, 10-item screening tool derived from the AQ, which can give a general indication of whether an individual might be autistic.[6]
    \*   The \*\*Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)\*\* and the \*\*Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS)\*\* are also translated and available in Romania.[23] However, the ASRS is typically used for children and adolescents.[16]

\*   \*\*Other Relevant Assessment Tools:\*\*
    \*   The \*\*Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-II)\*\* is a comprehensive assessment of adaptive skills across the lifespan (0-89 years) and is available in Romania. It assesses conceptual, social, and practical skills relevant to daily functioning.[16]



While the availability of translated "gold standard" tools like ADOS-2 and ADI-R in some public or private units is a positive development 23, their routine use in adult diagnosis across all of Romania might be constrained. These tools are time-consuming to administer and score, require specific training for clinicians, and the kits themselves can be costly.14 Given that mental health services can be chronically under-resourced 14, it is plausible that in practice, especially outside specialized centers or within the public system, clinicians may rely more on thorough clinical interviews and shorter screening questionnaires. While these are valuable, they may not always offer the same depth as a full assessment incorporating ADOS-2 and ADI-R. This potential variability in assessment thoroughness could impact the diagnostic experience and outcome for adults in Romania, depending on where they seek assessment and the resources available to the clinician.

**3. Accessing an Adult ASD Assessment in Romania: Practical Steps and Locations**

For adults in Romania who suspect they may have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and wish to seek a formal assessment, understanding the practical steps, available locations, and potential costs is essential. The landscape can be complex, with differences between public and private healthcare provisions.

- **3.1. Initiating the Process: Self-Referral vs. GP Referral**

The method for initiating an ASD assessment can vary. In many private clinics, individuals can typically **self-refer**, meaning they can contact the clinic or specialist directly to inquire about an assessment and schedule an appointment. This is often the most direct route, particularly if seeking services from a specific known specialist.

Alternatively, a **referral from a General Practitioner (GP) (medic de familie)** may be a pathway, especially if aiming to explore options within the public healthcare system or if hoping to utilize benefits from the National Health Insurance House (CNAS). For example, some services at Clinica Albion Medical in Bucharest can be accessed with a referral from a family doctor or another specialist for CNAS coverage, while direct payment is also an option.15

While direct self-referral to private specialists is common, obtaining a GP referral could be beneficial for ensuring a more integrated healthcare record. However, the specific pathways for CNAS-funded adult ASD _diagnostic assessments_ are not clearly delineated in available information, though some post-diagnosis therapies are covered.26 The general Romanian healthcare system often utilizes GP referrals for specialist consultations within the public sector. Given the reported limitations in public adult ASD services 14, the private route with self-referral is often perceived as more straightforward, albeit typically involving out-of-pocket expenses. It is advisable for individuals to check directly with specific clinics regarding their referral policies and any existing contracts with CNAS.

- **3.2. Navigating the Public vs. Private Healthcare System**

Adults seeking an ASD assessment in Romania will likely encounter differences between the public and private healthcare sectors. While some diagnostic tools are reportedly used in both "public or private units" 23, the public system faces significant challenges. There is a "limited service infrastructure for ASD diagnosis" and a notable "lack of services for adults with ASD in most regions of the country".23 This can translate to scarce public options, potentially long waiting lists, and services that are generally under-resourced.14

In contrast, a number of private clinics and specialists offering or implying adult ASD assessment services are identifiable, particularly in larger cities (e.g., Clinica Albion Medical, Clinica TMS, The Mind Institute, Med Anima, Clinica Hope). Personal accounts shared online also suggest that individuals often turn to private psychiatrists for diagnosis.7

The scarcity and perceived limitations of public sector services for adult ASD likely drive many individuals towards the private sector. While this may offer quicker access and potentially more specialized attention, it also introduces financial barriers to diagnosis for those who cannot afford private fees. This disparity means that access to diagnosis and subsequent support may depend significantly on an individual's financial resources and geographical location, raising concerns about equity in healthcare access.

- **3.3. Identified Clinics and Specialists by Major City**

The following table lists selected clinics and specialists across major Romanian cities where adult ASD assessment or related services may be available, based on the gathered information. It is important to note that explicit confirmation of adult ASD _diagnostic_ services should be sought directly from each provider, as some may focus more on therapy or have a primary pediatric focus.

This table highlights a concentration of explicitly mentioned services and specialists in Bucharest. Individuals in other regions may face greater challenges in finding local expertise and may need to consider travel or explore online consultation options where feasible for preliminary discussions, although a full diagnostic assessment typically requires in-person components. The general "lack of services for adults with ASD in most regions of the country" 23 underscores this geographical disparity.

- **3.4. The Registration and Appointment Process (General Overview)**

Specific, standardized registration processes for adult ASD diagnosis across Romania are not detailed in the available information. The procedure generally involves directly contacting the chosen clinic or specialist. For example, Clinica Împreună outlines a process of calling or writing, collaboratively setting an appointment, and then attending the clinic.32 Clinica Albion Medical provides options for scheduling appointments via phone or an online platform (Docbook).15

The absence of a unified, publicly documented registration pathway for adult ASD assessment suggests a somewhat fragmented system, where each clinic, particularly private ones, is likely to have its own intake procedures. Therefore, individuals will need to be proactive in:

1. Identifying potential clinics or specialists (e.g., using Table 2 or online directories like MediciAutism.ro).

2. Contacting them directly to inquire about their services for adult ASD diagnosis.

3. Asking about their specific registration process, any required documentation prior to the first appointment (e.g., previous medical records, referral letter if applicable).

4. Inquiring about waiting times for an initial consultation and for the full assessment process.

5. Clarifying costs and payment options.

This process of inquiry and appointment scheduling can itself be demanding, especially for individuals who may experience communication or executive functioning challenges often associated with ASD.

- **3.5. Considerations Regarding Costs and Potential CNAS Reimbursement**

The cost of an adult ASD assessment is a significant consideration. In the private sector, fees can be substantial. For instance, an initial adult autism consultation with Dr. Mihai Zamfir at Clinica TMS is listed at 440 lei for a 50-minute session, with a "2nd option" consultation for ADHD/autism at 500 lei for 60 minutes.27 The cost of standardized diagnostic tools themselves, such as the ADI-R, can also be high (e.g., US prices for kits are several hundred dollars), which can contribute to the overall expense of a comprehensive assessment.25

Regarding reimbursement through the National Health Insurance House (CNAS), the situation for adult ASD diagnostic assessments is not entirely clear.

\* Clinica Albion Medical indicates that their "Evaluare psihiatrie Autism Adulti" service can be accessed either with direct payment or through CAS (CNAS) 15, suggesting that some psychiatric consultations leading to or part of an ASD diagnosis may be covered.

\* Information from Help Autism specifies that children and adults with ASD can access a certain number of therapy sessions per month that are reimbursed by CNAS, at a rate of 135 lei per 50-minute session.26 This is positive for post-diagnostic support but does not explicitly cover the initial, comprehensive diagnostic assessment for adults.

\* General CNAS frameworks outline coverage for medical assistance, medications, and medical devices 37, and there are provisions for preventive health screenings for adults, including mental health evaluations for certain age groups.38 However, specific, detailed coverage for comprehensive adult ASD diagnostic evaluations is not prominently highlighted in these general documents.22

While CNAS may cover some psychiatric consultations that contribute to an ASD diagnosis, and it does offer reimbursement for some post-diagnosis therapy, it is less certain whether the full cost of extensive, multi-disciplinary adult ASD diagnostic assessments (which can involve multiple professionals, various tests, and several hours of clinical time) is covered. Such comprehensive evaluations are often undertaken in the private sector, implying significant out-of-pocket expenses.

Financial accessibility therefore remains a potential barrier. Individuals may need to weigh options between a potentially CNAS-covered psychiatric opinion (which might be less detailed) and a more comprehensive private assessment at a higher personal cost. It is imperative for individuals to clarify all costs and any potential for CNAS reimbursement directly with the chosen clinic or specialist before commencing an assessment.

**4. The Implications of an Adult ASD Diagnosis**

Receiving an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis in adulthood can be a life-altering event, bringing a mix of potential benefits, challenges, and considerations. Understanding these implications, particularly within the Romanian context, is crucial for anyone contemplating or undergoing the diagnostic process.

- **4.1. Potential Benefits: Self-Awareness, Validation, and Access to Support**

For many adults, an ASD diagnosis offers profound **clarity and self-understanding**. It can provide a coherent explanation for lifelong experiences of feeling "different" or struggling in social situations that were previously inexplicable.9 This newfound understanding can bring immense **relief**, reframing past difficulties not as personal failings or character flaws, but as manifestations of a neurodevelopmental difference.10 This shift in perspective can significantly boost self-esteem and confidence.10

A formal diagnosis can serve as **validation**, confirming an individual's own suspicions or the observations of those close to them, especially if they previously encountered skepticism.9 As one autistic individual expressed, after a lifetime of being mislabeled (e.g., "too sensitive," "too shy," "weird"), it can be incredibly empowering to assert, "No, I'm none of these things. I'm autistic".9 This validation is not merely about obtaining a label; for many, it represents a fundamental shift in self-identity and allows for a reinterpretation of their entire life history through a new, more accurate lens. The psychological impact of this can be deeply positive, fostering improved mental health and enabling a more authentic way of living.

Beyond personal understanding, a diagnosis can be instrumental in **accessing appropriate support and accommodations**. It can help individuals, as well as their families, partners, employers, and friends, to better understand their specific challenges and how they can be effectively supported.9 This may lead to reasonable adjustments in educational or work environments, or facilitate access to social care services or benefits where applicable.9

Furthermore, a diagnosis can **empower individuals to self-advocate** more effectively, as they have a clearer understanding of their own needs.9 It can also open doors to **peer support networks** within the autistic community, providing opportunities to connect with others who share similar experiences, which can reduce feelings of isolation and foster a sense of belonging.9 Finally, increased understanding stemming from a diagnosis can help reduce judgment from others who may not have previously understood the reasons behind certain behaviors or communication styles.9

- **4.2. Potential Challenges and Considerations in the Romanian Context**

While the benefits of an adult ASD diagnosis can be significant, it is important to acknowledge potential challenges, particularly within the Romanian context. One of the primary difficulties reported is **finding knowledgeable professionals** who are experienced in diagnosing and supporting autistic adults.7 Even after obtaining a diagnosis, accessing appropriate and effective **post-diagnostic support and therapy** can be a struggle.7

**Mental health stigma** persists in Romania, which can make seeking help for any mental health concern, including ASD, a difficult step for some individuals and their families.7 This societal context can also impact how a diagnosis is received by others.

A significant systemic issue is the **lack of services specifically designed for adults with ASD** in many regions of the country.23 Some individuals have described support for adults as "almost nonexistent".13 This means that a diagnosis, while validating, might not automatically unlock a clear pathway to comprehensive, state-funded support. This can lead to frustration if expectations are not managed. The diagnostic process itself can also be **lengthy, with potentially long waiting lists**, especially if pursuing assessment through public channels or for highly sought-after specialists.14

Some individuals may also have personal reservations about receiving a "label" and the potential implications that might carry.6 Historically, there have also been concerns regarding the legal recognition of adult autism for accessing certain benefits or services in Romania, though there is a framework for disability grading.39

Therefore, individuals pursuing a diagnosis in Romania should be aware that it is often the _beginning_ of a journey to find or create appropriate support, rather than an endpoint that guarantees access to a full suite of services. Self-advocacy and connecting with existing support networks, often led by NGOs, become critically important.

- **4.3. Understanding Legal Rights and Entitlements (e.g., disability grading)**

The legal landscape for autistic adults in Romania concerning rights and entitlements can be complex. Advocacy groups like ANCAAR have historically highlighted that the diagnosis of autism was not always adequately recognized for adults over 18 in terms of accessing specialized medical services or employment opportunities.39 While this information dates back to a 2011 campaign, the sentiment regarding inadequate support for adults has persisted in more recent analyses.7

However, there is a legal framework in place for the assessment and classification of disability in autistic adults. Ordinul nr. 692 din 23 mai 2013 (amending Order no. 762/1.992/2007) outlines the methodology for "încadrare în grad de handicap a persoanelor adulte autiste" (assigning a disability grade to autistic adults).40 This process involves:

\* A psychiatric examination.

\* Psychological testing (evaluating cognitive function, memory, attention, developmental level, language, and social autonomy).

\* Use of the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAFS).

The order defines criteria for different levels of disability (e.g., "handicap ușor" - mild, "mediu" - moderate, "accentuat" - pronounced, "grav" - severe) based on factors such as IQ, GAFS score, and adaptive functioning capabilities.40

Despite this legal framework for disability grading, a disconnect may exist between obtaining a disability certificate and the actual on-the-ground reality of accessing adequate services, support, and societal inclusion.14 This suggests that even with formal recognition of disability, autistic adults and their families may need to actively advocate for their rights and for the provision of necessary support. The process of obtaining the disability certificate itself, as outlined in the official methodology, requires navigating the medical system for the requisite examinations and evaluations.40 Organizations continue to advocate for the rights and improved services for autistic individuals in Romania.19

- **4.4. The Role of Self-Diagnosis and Community Acceptance**

In addition to formal diagnosis, the concept of **self-diagnosis** is relevant for many adults who suspect they are autistic. Self-diagnosis, often arrived at after extensive personal research and reflection on one's own traits and experiences in relation to established diagnostic criteria, is reported by some to have a positive effect on their lives.9 It can help individuals adjust and arrange informal support while awaiting a formal assessment or if formal diagnosis is inaccessible or not pursued.9

The adult autism community, particularly online, often shows acceptance towards self-diagnosed individuals, recognizing the barriers that can exist to obtaining a formal diagnosis, such as long waiting times, cost, or lack of knowledgeable professionals.9 Some online support groups explicitly welcome those who are self-suspecting or self-diagnosed.13 For many, self-diagnosis can be an important step in understanding themselves, finding community, and validating their experiences, even if it doesn't provide access to services requiring a formal medical diagnosis.9 However, some individuals prefer the certainty of a formal diagnosis to ensure their challenges are professionally recognized, to avoid misdiagnosis, or to feel their autistic identity is fully validated in society.9





\*\*Table 3: Weighing the Decision: Potential Pros and Cons of an Adult ASD Diagnosis in Romania\*\*



| **Potential Pros** | **Potential Cons/Challenges (Romanian Context)** |
| **Increased Self-Understanding & Validation:** Provides an explanation for lifelong differences and challenges, leading to relief and improved self-esteem.9 | **Stigma & Misunderstanding:** Mental health stigma persists in Romania; diagnosis may not always be understood or accepted by family, employers, or society.7 |
| **Access to Information & Strategies:** Helps individuals learn about ASD and effective coping strategies tailored to their neurotype.9 | **Limited Post-Diagnosis Support:** Scarcity of specialized services for adults with ASD in many regions; finding knowledgeable therapists can be difficult.7 |
| **Improved Relationships:** Can help family, friends, and partners understand the individual's communication style, sensory sensitivities, and support needs, potentially improving relationships.9 | **"Labeling" Concerns:** Some individuals may be hesitant about receiving a formal "label" and its potential societal implications.6 |
| **Access to Support Services & Accommodations:** May facilitate access to therapies (some CNAS reimbursed 26), reasonable adjustments at work/education, and potentially social benefits or disability grading.9 | **Challenges in Accessing Entitlements:** Navigating the system for disability grading can be complex, and a certificate may not automatically guarantee adequate support or inclusion.39 |
| **Empowerment & Self-Advocacy:** A diagnosis can empower individuals to better understand and advocate for their needs.9 | **Cost & Accessibility of Diagnosis:** Comprehensive private assessments can be expensive; public pathways may have long waits or be limited.14 |
| **Connection with Autistic Community:** Facilitates finding peer support groups and connecting with other autistic individuals who share similar experiences.9 | **Emotional Impact:** The diagnostic process and receiving a diagnosis can be emotionally intense, potentially bringing up past difficulties or requiring adjustment. |
| **Clarity for Professionals:** Provides a framework for healthcare and mental health professionals to understand the individual's needs.9 | **Variability in Professional Knowledge:** Some professionals in Romania may still have limited understanding of adult ASD presentations.7 |

**5. Life After Diagnosis: Support and Resources for Autistic Adults in Romania**

Receiving an ASD diagnosis as an adult is often the beginning of a new chapter. While challenges in accessing comprehensive support exist in Romania, various therapeutic interventions, organizations, and communities can offer valuable assistance.

- **5.1. Overview of Available Therapeutic Interventions**

A range of therapeutic approaches can be beneficial for autistic adults, aimed at improving symptoms, developing coping skills, and enhancing quality of life. These may include 12:

\* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Adapted for autistic individuals, CBT can help with managing anxiety, depression, understanding social situations, and developing coping strategies. Some clinicians in Romania have training in CBT for autism.30

\* Social Skills Training: Group or individual sessions focused on improving understanding of social cues, conversational skills, and navigating social interactions.

\* Occupational Therapy: Can help with sensory sensitivities, daily living skills, and strategies for managing routines and organizational challenges.

\* Speech and Language Therapy: May be relevant for adults with specific communication challenges.

\* Psychotherapy/Counseling: General supportive therapy can help individuals process their diagnosis, explore their identity, and address emotional well-being.12

\* Medication: Psychiatrists may prescribe medication to manage co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression, or ADHD, which are common in autistic individuals.23

The Asociația Națională Pentru Copii și Adulți cu Autism din România (ANCAAR) emphasizes that therapeutic interventions for adults need to be individualized and creative, as "templates don't work".41 They highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that can include behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, and social skills groups, always tailored to the individual's specific needs and strengths.

A positive development is that some therapy sessions for individuals with ASD (including adults) can be reimbursed by the National Health Insurance House (CNAS). Help Autism reports that up to two therapy sessions per day (within a monthly limit) can be covered, with a reimbursed tariff of 135 lei per 50-minute session.26

However, the primary challenge in Romania often lies not in the lack of knowledge about _which_ therapies can be helpful, but in the limited availability and accessibility of these services, especially outside major urban centers like Bucharest. Furthermore, finding therapists with specific training and experience in adapting these interventions effectively for the unique needs of _autistic adults_ can be difficult.7 Individuals may need to actively search for qualified professionals.

- **5.2. National and Local Associations and NGOs**

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and associations play a vital role in Romania by providing services, support, and advocacy for autistic individuals and their families, often filling gaps where state provision is lacking. Key organizations include:





\*   \*\*ANCAAR (Asociația Națională Pentru Copii și Adulți cu Autism din România):\*\* A national association with branches in various cities (e.g., Iași, Craiova, Argeș).[43] They provide resources, advocate for rights, and emphasize individualized therapeutic approaches for adults.[39, 41]
\*   \*\*Institutul Autism Voice:\*\* Based in Bucharest, this organization offers programs for adolescents and adults, including the "LIFE Autism" program (focusing on community engagement, personal autonomy, communication, social activities, and functional academic skills) and adult psychotherapy services.[42]
\*   \*\*Help Autism:\*\* Actively involved in issues like the reimbursement of therapy services by CNAS and likely offers direct services, primarily focused on children but with advocacy relevant to adults.[26]
\*   \*\*Autism Transilvania (Cluj-Napoca):\*\* Provides psychological evaluations, including for adults using tools like ADOS.[16]
\*   \*\*Autism Fedra:\*\* A federation that lists various autism-related associations across Romania.[43] While many member organizations are child-focused, it can be a starting point for identifying local resources. ANCAAR is listed as a member.[43]
\*   \*\*Romanian Association of Therapies in Autism and ADHD (ARTAADHD):\*\* Listed as a parent support group, which may offer resources or connections.[44]
\*   Other associations, particularly in Bucharest, such as "Învingem Autismul," "AUTISM ROMANIA – Asociația Părinților Copiilor cu Autism," "Fundația Romanian Angel Appeal," "Asociaţia PUZZLE ROMANIA," and "Asociația pentru Recuperarea și Integrarea Copiilor cu Autism (ARICA)" may also have resources or be able to direct individuals to adult services, though their primary focus has often been on children.[43]



The NGO sector is critical, but its capacity and geographical reach can be limited, often relying on donations and project-based funding. This means service availability can be inconsistent. Individuals are encouraged to research the specific services offered to adults by these organizations.

- **5.3. Online Communities and Peer Support Networks**

Peer support is invaluable for many autistic adults, offering a space for shared experiences, validation, and practical advice. Online communities can be particularly accessible:

\* International Forums: Platforms like Reddit have communities (e.g., r/AutismInWomen, r/aspergirls, r/AutisticAdults, r/neurodiversity) where Romanians also participate, seeking advice and sharing experiences.7

\* Romanian Online Groups: There are online groups within Romania, though some users have found that while they offer stories and advice, they may not always emphasize the creation of friendships or offer deep mutual emotional support.7 The project "About ADHD România" aims to create resources and has a support group that also caters to the autistic community in Romania.46

\* There is a noted desire among some autistic adults in Romania for more in-person community building and opportunities for social connection, as online interactions may not fully meet these needs.7 This suggests an unmet need for Romanian-centric online and offline communities that foster deeper social bonds.

Given the scarcity of formal adult support services and the expressed desire for genuine connection, informal peer support networks—whether online or potentially self-initiated in local areas—become exceptionally important for well-being and navigating life as an autistic adult in Romania.

- **5.4. Initiatives for Independent Living and Employment**

Achieving independent living and securing meaningful employment are crucial aspects of adult life. In Romania, systemic support in these areas for autistic adults is still developing.

\* Campus NIA: This is a notable project by the HopeFromNIA organization, described as a unique initiative in Romania dedicated to providing residential support for adults with autism. The campus aims to offer specially adapted housing, a therapy center, and a space for continuous learning, fostering an autism-friendly environment that supports independent living and development.47 Such pioneering NGO initiatives highlight the significant need rather than representing widespread solutions.

\* Advocacy for Rights: ANCAAR discusses the right to housing and employment for autistic adults, acknowledging the considerable challenges but also emphasizing the potential and talents of individuals on the spectrum.39 They point out the historical lack of job opportunities and appropriate housing solutions beyond group homes or psychiatric facilities for adults post-18.

\* Transition Support: Autism Romania has organized events focusing on the rights of young autistic adults, noting that an increasing number of autistic students will be transitioning out of the educational system and will require adequate support within the community.48 This highlights an awareness of the need, though robust services may not yet be widely in place.

For most autistic adults in Romania, achieving independent living and employment likely requires substantial personal and familial effort, alongside reliance on the few available NGO programs. There is a critical need for more state-supported and widespread initiatives in these vital areas.

**6. Navigating Challenges and Moving Forward: Recommendations**

The journey of seeking an ASD assessment and navigating life post-diagnosis as an adult in Romania comes with unique challenges and opportunities. The following recommendations are intended to help individuals approach this process with greater preparedness and self-advocacy.

- **6.1. Preparing for an Assessment**

Thorough preparation can significantly aid the assessment process. Consider the following steps:

\* Gather Personal History: Reflect on and document lifelong patterns related to social interaction, communication styles, sensory sensitivities, strong interests, and adherence to routines. Information about early developmental milestones, if available (even from personal memory or family anecdotes), can be very helpful.1

\* Involve Trusted Individuals (Optional): If comfortable and feasible, speak with family members (parents, siblings, long-term partners) who may recall early developmental details or can offer observations about current functioning.

\* Complete Self-Assessment Tools (for reflection): Tools like the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) or the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale – Revised (RAADS-R) (an online version is mentioned by Ovidiu Platon 24) can be used as a preliminary step to organize thoughts and identify areas for discussion with a clinician. It is crucial to remember these are not diagnostic tools themselves but can help in articulating experiences.

\* Prepare Questions: Write down any questions or concerns to discuss with the clinician during the assessment.

Given that some clinicians may have limited experience with adult ASD presentations 7, an individual who is well-prepared and can clearly articulate their experiences in relation to established diagnostic criteria 2 may facilitate a more accurate and efficient assessment. This empowers the individual, shifting them from a purely passive recipient of healthcare to an active participant in their diagnostic journey.

- **6.2. Advocating for Your Needs**

Due to the previously discussed limitations within the Romanian healthcare system regarding adult ASD services 14, self-advocacy is often essential.

\* Be Persistent: If initial attempts to seek assessment are met with dismissal or lack of understanding, do not be discouraged. If one professional does not seem knowledgeable about adult ASD, consider seeking a second opinion, if resources allow.

\* Communicate Clearly: Articulate specific needs, challenges, and how they impact daily functioning. Providing concrete examples can be more effective than general statements.

\* Post-Diagnosis Advocacy: If a diagnosis is received, advocate for appropriate support and reasonable adjustments in educational or employment settings. While the practical application of rights for autistic adults in Romania can be challenging 39, being aware of the existing legal framework for disability can support these efforts.

In a system where resources and awareness for adult ASD may be limited, the responsibility often falls on the individual or their family to drive the process of seeking diagnosis and appropriate support. While this can be demanding, proactive engagement is frequently crucial for achieving positive outcomes. This underscores a broader need for systemic improvements, including increased funding for adult mental health services and specialized training for professionals in Romania.

- **6.3. Building a Support System**

A diagnosis of ASD can be an emotionally significant experience. Building a robust support system is vital for well-being and navigating life with this new understanding.

\* Connect with Peers: Seek out other autistic adults. This can be done through online communities, both international ones where Romanians participate 7 and Romanian-specific groups like the one associated with "About ADHD România".46 Explore local groups that may be facilitated by NGOs listed in Table 4. Peer support offers validation, shared experiences, and practical advice that can be uniquely comforting and empowering.9

\* Educate Family and Friends: Share information about ASD with trusted family members and friends to help them understand your experiences and needs. Their support can be invaluable.

\* Engage with Advocacy Organizations: NGOs like ANCAAR or Autism Voice can provide resources, information, and a sense of community.

Given the reported scarcity of formal adult support services in many parts of Romania and the expressed desire for genuine social connection 7, informal peer support networks become exceptionally important. These networks, whether online or in-person (even if self-initiated), can provide crucial validation, practical strategies, and emotional sustenance that may not be readily available through official channels. Fostering and supporting the development of autistic-led communities and peer support initiatives should be a priority for both NGOs and public health efforts in Romania.

Seeking an ASD assessment as an adult in Romania requires navigating a complex system. However, with preparation, self-advocacy, and the development of a supportive network, individuals can gain valuable self-understanding and work towards a more fulfilling life.
