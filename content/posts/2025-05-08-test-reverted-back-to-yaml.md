# **Angi Șerban and the "Corupția Ucide" Movement: A Profile of Contemporary Romanian Activism**

## **1\. Introduction**

Romania's post-communist transition has been significantly marked by persistent challenges related to corruption and the consolidation of democratic institutions. Within this context, civil society has played a fluctuating but often crucial role in demanding accountability and reform. The tragic Colectiv nightclub fire in 2015 served as a potent catalyst, galvanizing public anger and giving rise to new forms of civic mobilization, prominently featuring the slogan "Corupția ucide" (Corruption Kills). This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Angi Șerban, a notable activist figure who emerged within this milieu, and the civic organization "Corupția Ucide" (Corruption Kills), where she holds the position of Vice President. Drawing upon publicly available information, this analysis examines Șerban's biographical details, her role within the organization, the history and activities of "Corupția Ucide," key campaigns and public statements, media reception, and the reported impact of their activism on Romanian society and politics. The report aims to synthesize these elements into a nuanced profile, shedding light on the dynamics, challenges, and significance of contemporary anti-corruption activism in Romania.

## **2\. Biographical Profile of Angi Șerban**

Available sources provide limited biographical data on Angi Șerban beyond her activism. She was identified as being 36 years old in January 2024\.1 Her involvement in civic protests appears to have intensified following the Colectiv nightclub fire in late 2015, a moment she identified as a personal turning point ("declicul").8 She is frequently associated with the \#Rezist movement, a broader wave of anti-government and anti-corruption protests prominent since 2017\.5

Information regarding her education and professional background presents some ambiguity. In response to public questioning about her employment status, Șerban identified herself as a jurist by training 8 and stated she worked as a sales director for a small company.12 She asserted that she self-finances her activism.12 However, this self-representation contrasts with commentary from critics or media figures who have questioned whether she has regular employment, sometimes labeling her a "professional protester" 16 or implying activism is her primary occupation.12 This discrepancy highlights a common line of criticism directed at activists, often aimed at undermining their legitimacy by suggesting they are not representative of "ordinary" working citizens or are potentially funded by external interests. The available data does not allow for independent verification of her professional status beyond her own statements and the critical commentary surrounding it. No specific details regarding her formal education were found in the examined sources.4

## **3\. Angi Șerban's Role in "Corupția Ucide"**

Angi Șerban holds a formal leadership position within the "Corupția Ucide" organization. She was explicitly identified as the Vice President of the organization during the commemoration event marking seven years since the Colectiv tragedy in October 2022\.30

While a detailed job description is unavailable, her responsibilities can be inferred from her documented activities. As Vice President, she publicly represents the organization, as seen in her statements at the Colectiv commemoration.30 She speaks at public events and protests, addressing crowds from platforms, indicating a role in public communication and mobilization.31 Furthermore, she is involved in co-organizing protests alongside other NGOs, such as the demonstration in support of journalist Emilia Șercan.32 Given her active and distinct online presence, including the use of the alias "Fata cu goarna" (The Girl with the Bullhorn) 4, it is plausible she contributes to the group's digital communication and outreach strategy, aligning with the organization's significant reliance on social media. Her signature appears alongside other civil society representatives on joint appeals and statements, signifying her role in inter-organizational collaborations.24
