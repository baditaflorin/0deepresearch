## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive public profile and network analysis of Kapitän zur See (Captain) Daniel Wolfen, a distinguished officer in the German Navy. Publicly available information indicates a career characterized by a methodical progression through operational command, strategic planning, and high-level policy and staff appointments within the German Bundeswehr, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Contrary to some public mischaracterizations, his recent senior roles at NATO were not that of a "Vice President," but the far more specific and influential positions of **Military Assistant to the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR)** at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and, subsequently, **Counselor, NATO**, in Brussels.1

The central themes of Kapitän zur See Wolfen's career are threefold. First, his trajectory demonstrates a deliberate cultivation from a tactical specialist—a naval aviator—into a strategic planner and senior policy advisor. Second, he possesses extensive and repeated experience within multinational command structures, having served in key roles for both the EU Naval Force and NATO. Third, his career path, particularly his most recent appointments, marks him as a high-potential officer being groomed for senior flag rank within the German military establishment.

His core competencies are extensive, covering naval aviation, multinational operational planning, military policy development with a specific focus on the Asia-Pacific region, and high-level staff work within major military alliances. A key finding of this report is that Kapitän zur See Wolfen has consistently operated at the nexus of command, serving as a direct aide and "gatekeeper" to some of NATO's most senior military leaders. Crucially, his tenure as Military Assistant to the DSACEUR coincided with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, placing him at the epicenter of the Alliance's military crisis management and strategic response during a period of historic geopolitical realignment. This experience has afforded him an exceptional level of access, influence, and insight into the highest levels of transatlantic defense and security decision-making.

## **Section 1: Foundations of a Naval Officer: Education and Early Career**

The foundational experiences of an officer's career often provide a clear indication of their future trajectory and core competencies. In the case of Kapitän zur See Daniel Wolfen, his academic and early military training reveal a profile built on a unique integration of military discipline, academic rigor, and early exposure to multinational operations. These formative years established the basis for his subsequent advancements into roles of significant strategic importance.

### **1.1 The Bundeswehr Scholar: An Integrated Academic and Military Path**

Kapitän zur See Wolfen's career began with two years of compulsory military service in the Panzergrenadiertruppe (Armored Infantry) from July 1996 to June 1998\.2 Following this initial service, he transitioned to the German Navy and was selected for the officer track, which included a university education as an integral component of his development. From 1999 to 2002, he attended the

**Helmut-Schmidt-Universität \- Universität der Bundeswehr Hamburg**, where he earned a Diploma in Business Administration with a specialization in finance.1

It is critical to understand that the Helmut Schmidt University is not a civilian institution but one of two federal universities established by the Bundeswehr specifically for the education of its officer corps.3 The university's mission is to provide "education through science" that is "committed to social responsibility," ensuring that future leaders are not only militarily proficient but also academically grounded.3 The academic programs are designed as intensive study courses, structured in trimesters, which allows students to obtain bachelor's and master's degrees in a significantly shorter timeframe than at public universities.3 The degrees awarded are fully equivalent to those from state universities, and the institution is authorized to confer doctoral degrees and habilitations.4

The selection of a Business Administration degree for a naval officer is not a path toward a corporate career but a strategic specialization designed by the Bundeswehr. The curriculum focus on finance, risk allocation, and futures trading provided Wolfen with a strong analytical foundation in resource management, budgetary planning, and complex systems analysis.2 These skills are highly prized in senior military leadership, where decisions often involve the allocation of vast resources, management of the military-industrial complex, and long-term strategic financial planning. This early, specialized education distinguishes him from officers with a purely operational background and foreshadows his later aptitude for strategic planning and policy roles at the ministerial and alliance levels. He is a product of an integrated German military education system that identifies and cultivates the intellectual and leadership potential of its future senior officers from the very beginning of their careers.

### **1.2 Forging a Specialist: Advanced Military and Flight Training**

Following the completion of his academic degree, Kapitän zur See Wolfen embarked on a period of intensive, specialized military training that further defined his career path as a naval aviator and deepened his integration into the NATO operational environment. From October 2003 to November 2005, he underwent comprehensive pilot training with both the **German Marine (Navy)** and, significantly, the **United States Navy**.2 This multinational training program exposed him to a wide variety of aircraft and operational doctrines. His U.S. Navy training included flying the T-34C "Turbo Mentor" with Training Squadron VT-3, the TH-57 "Sea Ranger" with Helicopter Training Squadron HT-8, and the SH-60F "Seahawk" with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron HS-10.2 This was complemented by training in Germany on the platforms he would later operate: the Sea Lynx Mk88A helicopter and the Dornier 228 fixed-wing aircraft.1

This early and deep immersion in the U.S. Navy's training system is a critical data point. It signifies more than just technical qualification; it represents a formative exposure to the procedures, communication protocols, and operational culture of NATO's leading military power. Such experiences foster a natural level of interoperability and a transatlantic perspective that are invaluable for an officer destined for roles within the Alliance. This foundation makes his later senior appointment at the U.S.-led Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) a logical and seamless career progression, rather than a novel assignment.

The capstone of his advanced military education came later, from 2010 to 2012, when he attended the two-year **General-/Admiralstaff Course** at the prestigious **Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr** (German Armed Forces Command and Staff College) in Hamburg.1 This course is the German equivalent of the war colleges of other major military powers and is a prerequisite for promotion to the highest ranks. The curriculum is explicitly focused on national and international security and defense policy, strategic studies, and, crucially, the practicalities of cooperation with international partners in multinational staffs.2 This formal education in strategic thought and alliance operations provided the theoretical framework that would underpin his subsequent performance in high-level command and staff roles.

## **Section 2: Command, Policy, and Operations: A Career Trajectory Analysis**

An analysis of Kapitän zur See Wolfen's professional history reveals a carefully managed career, alternating between operational command, where he honed his leadership and tactical skills, and strategic staff roles, where he contributed to policy and planning at the highest levels. This trajectory demonstrates a clear path of increasing responsibility, culminating in his recent appointments at the heart of the NATO alliance.

### **2.1 The Aviator and Commander: Leading from the Cockpit and the Command Post**

After completing his pilot training, Wolfen's career progressed through a series of operational and command assignments. He served as a pilot with the Bundeswehr from 2005 to 2010, flying both the Sea Lynx Mk88A helicopter and the Dornier 228 fixed-wing aircraft as a co-pilot and pilot-in-command.1 His operational command experience began in earnest when he was appointed

**Commanding Officer of the 2nd Squadron, Naval Air Wing 3 "Graf Zeppelin"**, a position he held from October 2012 to May 2015\. In this role, he led a naval aviation squadron and flew the Dornier 228 maritime patrol aircraft based in Nordholz, Germany.1

During this command tour, he undertook a significant expeditionary command role as the **Commander of the P-3C Task Force in Djibouti** for the European Union Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) Operation ATALANTA. Though a short deployment from December 2012 to February 2013, this assignment provided him with firsthand experience leading a multinational detachment in a complex operational theater focused on counter-piracy.2

Later in his career, from October 2019 to September 2021, he returned to a command role, this time as the **Training Group Commander (OF-4)** at the **Naval Operations School (Marineoperationsschule)** in Bremerhaven.1 In this capacity, he was responsible for leading the staff and trainees of five squadrons and supervising the critical operational training for all future combat-information-center (CIC) personnel of the German Navy.1 An examination of his career reveals a recurring pattern where operational command experience is directly followed by roles in training and education. This progression suggests a deliberate strategy by the German Navy to leverage his firsthand operational knowledge to shape the doctrine and skills of the next generation of naval personnel. This ability to not only execute missions but also to institutionalize the lessons learned marks him as a particularly valuable leader, capable of both leading the force and developing it.

### **2.2 The Strategic Planner in a Multinational Theater: Operation ATALANTA**

A critical inflection point in Kapitän zur See Wolfen's career occurred between December 2020 and July 2021, when he was assigned as the **Head of Strategic Planning (Assistant Chief of Staff)** for **EU NAVFOR Somalia Operation ATALANTA**.1 A video produced during this period identifies him by his specific title,

**"Commander Daniel Wolfen, Branch Chief for Strategic Plans & Assessment"**.5 This role placed him within the Operation Headquarters (OHQ) in Rota, Spain, at the strategic heart of the EU's flagship anti-piracy mission.6

This assignment represented a significant evolution from his previous tactical command role within the same operation eight years prior. Where he had once commanded a deployed P-3C aircraft detachment, he was now responsible for the long-term strategic planning for the entire multinational naval force, which includes protecting World Food Programme vessels, deterring piracy, and monitoring illicit maritime activities.1 This progression from tactical execution to strategic direction demonstrates that his superiors recognized his capacity for higher-level thinking beyond asset command. His proven success in this complex, non-NATO, EU-led multinational environment would have significantly burnished his credentials and prepared him for the even larger and more complex political-military machinery of NATO.

### **2.3 The Policy Advisor: The German Ministry of Defence**

Between his command and multinational staff tours, Kapitän zur See Wolfen served a crucial assignment that broadened his geopolitical aperture. From September 2017 to October 2019, he was a **Desk Officer (Referent) for Military Policy Asia/Pacific** at the German Federal Ministry of Defence in Berlin.1 This posting was fundamentally different from his operational roles, moving him from naval and alliance-specific matters to the formulation of national defense and foreign policy.

His focus on the Asia-Pacific region is particularly noteworthy. This assignment placed him at the center of Germany's strategic thinking and policy development regarding the evolving security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, including the rise of China and the strengthening of partnerships with countries in the region. Such a role requires a broader, joint-service, and diplomatic perspective, forcing an officer to consider how military capabilities serve wider national strategic objectives. This experience in the national policy-making crucible of a major ministry is essential for developing the political acumen required for flag rank and for understanding the complex interplay between military action and statecraft. It was ideal preparation for the intensely political-military environment of NATO's senior headquarters.

### **2.4 The Apex of Alliance Politics: SHAPE and NATO HQ**

The culmination of Wolfen's career progression to date has been his assignments at the highest echelons of the NATO command structure. From September 2021 to March 2025, he served as the **Military Assistant to the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR)** at SHAPE in Mons, Belgium.1 This position is one of the most influential and demanding staff roles an officer of his rank can hold. The Military Assistant acts as a combination of chief of staff, principal advisor, and administrative "gatekeeper" for a four-star general or admiral, controlling the flow of information and access to one of the two most powerful military commanders in the Alliance.8

His tenure in this role was defined by a period of profound crisis for European security. He began his tour just months before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and remained in the post for the subsequent years of intense crisis management and strategic realignment within NATO. This placed him at the absolute epicenter of the Alliance's military response, privy to the highest-level intelligence assessments, operational planning sessions, and political-military consultations that shaped NATO's posture.

Following this demanding tour, in March 2025, he transitioned to the role of **Counselor, NATO**, based at the alliance's political headquarters in Brussels.1 This move from the operational-strategic command at SHAPE to the political-strategic headquarters is a logical progression. It allows him to leverage the immense experience, detailed knowledge, and extensive network he built as a key gatekeeper during a time of war, applying it now within the primary forum for political consultation and decision-making among the 32 allies.

## **Section 3: Network and Influence: A Sourced Analysis of Professional Associates**

An officer's influence and effectiveness are often a function of their professional network. For Kapitän zur See Wolfen, his career has placed him in direct working relationships with some of the most senior military leaders in NATO, the EU, and the German Bundeswehr. This section provides a detailed, sourced analysis of these publicly documented connections.

### **3.1 The NATO/SHAPE Command Echelon (2021-2025)**

Wolfen's role as Military Assistant to the DSACEUR from September 2021 to March 2025 positioned him as a key staff officer within the immediate command group of SHAPE. He served two different four-star commanders during a period of leadership transition and immense geopolitical turmoil.

* **Direct Superior 1: General Sir Tim Radford (British Army)**  
  * **Connection:** Wolfen was the Military Assistant to General Radford from the start of his tour in September 2021 until General Radford's retirement in July 2023\.1  
  * **Context:** As DSACEUR, General Radford was a central figure in designing and implementing NATO's initial military response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As his primary staff officer, Wolfen would have been intimately involved in managing the crisis, preparing briefings, coordinating staff work, and facilitating the General's command decisions. General Radford, a highly decorated officer with extensive special forces and operational command experience, retired from the military and subsequently joined The Cohen Group, a prominent strategic advisory firm, as a Senior Counselor in April 2024\.10 This relationship connects Wolfen directly to a key figure in NATO's recent history.  
* **Direct Superior 2: Admiral Sir Keith Blount (Royal Navy)**  
  * **Connection:** When Admiral Blount succeeded General Radford as DSACEUR in July 2023, Wolfen remained in his post as Military Assistant, serving him until March 2025\.1  
  * **Context:** Admiral Blount came to the DSACEUR position directly from his role as Commander of NATO's Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM).8 Wolfen's own extensive naval and naval aviation background would have made him an exceptionally suitable and trusted assistant for a new naval DSACEUR, ensuring a seamless transition of command support. Serving as the point of continuity during a change of command at this level, particularly during wartime, underscores the high degree of trust placed in him by the Alliance's leadership.  
* **Supreme Allied Commanders Europe (SACEUR) during his tenure:**  
  * **General Tod D. Wolters (U.S. Air Force):** SACEUR from May 2019 to July 2022\.12  
  * **General Christopher G. Cavoli (U.S. Army):** SACEUR from July 2022 to July 2025\.13  
  * **Context:** While the SACEUR was not his direct superior, the DSACEUR is the SACEUR's deputy. As Military Assistant to the DSACEUR, Wolfen would have had significant and regular professional interaction with both SACEURs and their immediate staffs. He would have been responsible for preparing the DSACEUR for meetings with the SACEUR, tracking SACEUR's directives, and ensuring staff alignment between the two highest military offices in NATO's operational command.

| Key NATO/SHAPE Leadership During Wolfen's Tenure (2021-2025) |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Position** | **Name** | **Service/Nationality** | **Tenure Dates** | **Note on Interaction with Wolfen** |
| Deputy SACEUR | General Sir Tim Radford | British Army | Apr 2020 \- Jul 2023 | Direct superior. Wolfen served as his Military Assistant during the initial phase of the Ukraine war.1 |
| Deputy SACEUR | Admiral Sir Keith Blount | Royal Navy | Jul 2023 \- Present | Direct superior. Wolfen served as his Military Assistant, providing continuity after the command change.1 |
| SACEUR | General Tod D. Wolters | U.S. Air Force | May 2019 \- Jul 2022 | Head of SHAPE during the first part of Wolfen's tour. Wolfen would have had significant staff-level interaction.12 |
| SACEUR | General Christopher G. Cavoli | U.S. Army | Jul 2022 \- Jul 2025 | Head of SHAPE during the latter part of Wolfen's tour. Wolfen would have witnessed his command philosophy firsthand.13 |

### **3.2 The EU NAVFOR ATALANTA Leadership Constellation (c. 2020-2021)**

During his tour as Head of Strategic Planning for Operation ATALANTA, Wolfen operated within a distinct, EU-led command structure based in Rota, Spain. His work directly supported the senior leadership responsible for the mission's execution.

* **Operation Commander: Vice Admiral José M. Núñez Torrente (Spanish Navy)**  
  * **Connection:** Appointed as the overall Operation Commander on April 21, 2021, during Wolfen's tour.15 As Head of Strategic Planning, Wolfen's work would have been conducted under the Admiral's ultimate authority and would have been essential for shaping the mission's future direction.  
* **Force Commander: Rear Admiral Ignacio Villanueva Serrano (Spanish Navy)**  
  * **Connection:** Appointed as the embarked Force Commander in March 2020, serving throughout Wolfen's tour.15 The Force Commander is the senior officer in the area of operations. Wolfen's strategic plans, developed at the headquarters in Spain, would have been designed to directly support Admiral Villanueva's deployed forces at sea. Admiral Villanueva was later promoted to Vice Admiral and himself became the Operation Commander.17

### **3.3 The German Bundeswehr Peer and Command Network**

Mapping Wolfen's connections within the German Navy reveals a cohort of officers with interconnected career paths, suggesting a coordinated personnel management strategy for high-potential individuals.

* **Naval Operations School (2019-2021):**  
  * **Superior: Captain Eckhard Bödecker.** As Commander of the Naval Operations School, Captain Bödeker was Wolfen's direct superior until August 2021\. A report from *Marineforum Online* on the change-of-command ceremony explicitly states that upon his departure, Captain Bödeker was being transferred to **NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE)** in Brussels.19 This transfer occurred just one month before Wolfen himself began his assignment at SHAPE in September 2021\.1 This proximity in timing and destination strongly suggests a coordinated placement of trusted officers by the German Navy into key Alliance positions.  
  * **Successor Commander: Captain Jens Grimm.** He assumed command of the school from Captain Bödeker in August 2021\. Grimm's previous role was Adjutant to the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, the highest-ranking military officer in Germany, indicating his own high standing.19  
  * **Presiding Officer: Rear Admiral Christoph Müller-Meinhard.** As Commander Support and Head of the Operational Support Department at the Naval Command, he presided over the change-of-command ceremony, placing him in Wolfen's senior leadership chain.19  
* **Naval Air Wing 3 "Graf Zeppelin" (2012-2015):**  
  * **Superior 1: Fregattenkapitän Broder Nielsen.** Served as Kommodore (Wing Commander) of MFG 3 from October 2012 to April 2013\.21  
  * **Superior 2: Fregattenkapitän Per Fritz Weiler.** Succeeded Nielsen and served as Kommodore from April 2013 to November 2015, covering the majority of Wolfen's tour as a squadron commander.21 As a Squadron Commander, Wolfen would have reported directly to these Wing Commanders.

### **3.4 Other Documented Professional Engagements**

* **Kenichiro Toko (Consulate General):** A U.S. Army video documents an event at the 7th Army NCO Academy where a "Wolfen, Germany" was present. The event featured a speech by Kenichiro Toko on the importance of the NATO partnership.22 While the source lacks a first name or rank for Wolfen, the context—a German officer at a U.S. Army facility in Germany at an event focused on NATO—makes it highly probable that this is the same Daniel Wolfen. This suggests his participation in broader military diplomacy and outreach activities, reinforcing the transatlantic aspects of his professional life.

## **Section 4: Synthesis and Professional Assessment**

A holistic review of Kapitän zur See Daniel Wolfen's career, education, and professional network allows for a detailed assessment of his capabilities and future potential. The evidence points to a highly competent, versatile, and politically astute officer who embodies the modern requirements for senior military leadership in a complex, alliance-based security environment.

### **4.1 Profile of a Modern Military-Diplomat**

Kapitän zur See Wolfen's professional development has systematically built a skill set that transcends traditional military specialization. He represents a modern archetype of a senior officer who is simultaneously a technical expert, an operational commander, a strategic planner, and a military diplomat.

His technical proficiency is rooted in his training as a naval aviator, including complex helicopter and fixed-wing maritime patrol operations.1 This is complemented by deep operational experience, from commanding a squadron in the German Navy to leading a multinational task force in the EU's counter-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa.1 However, his career is defined by the deliberate layering of strategic competencies on top of this operational foundation. His business administration degree provides a unique analytical lens for resource management and planning.1 His tour in the German Ministry of Defence gave him direct experience in national-level policy formulation, specifically in a region of growing global importance, the Indo-Pacific.1 His roles in both EU and NATO headquarters have made him an expert in the mechanics of multinational military cooperation.1 His fluency in English and French, the two official languages of NATO, is a critical enabler that significantly enhances his effectiveness in these international environments.1

The synergistic effect of these experiences cannot be overstated. His U.S. Navy training provided early integration with a key ally. His EU planning role demonstrated adaptability outside the NATO framework. His work as Military Assistant at SHAPE placed him at the nexus of strategic decision-making during a continental war. This combination has produced an officer who is not just a German naval captain, but a true transatlantic and European security professional.

### **4.2 Trajectory and Outlook**

The career path of Kapitän zur See Wolfen does not appear to be accidental. The consistent alternation between demanding operational commands and key strategic staff and policy positions is indicative of a deliberate grooming process by the German Navy for an officer identified as having high potential for flag rank. His placement in critical roles at pivotal moments—such as Head of Strategic Planning for ATALANTA and, most significantly, Military Assistant to the DSACEUR during the Alliance's response to the war in Ukraine—demonstrates an exceptionally high level of trust placed in him by both his national and international superiors.

Based on this clear and consistent trajectory, Kapitän zur See Wolfen is exceptionally well-positioned for future senior leadership roles. His deep experience in multinational settings, combined with his operational credibility and policy acumen, makes him a prime candidate for several potential future appointments. These could include command of a major German or NATO naval formation, leadership of a multinational joint task force, or a return to a senior leadership position within the NATO or EU military staff structures. He would also be a strong candidate to serve as a defense attaché in a key allied capital, such as Washington D.C. or Paris, where his skills and network would be invaluable. In essence, his career to date serves as a case study in how a modern military power develops the strategic leaders required to navigate the complex security challenges of the 21st century.
