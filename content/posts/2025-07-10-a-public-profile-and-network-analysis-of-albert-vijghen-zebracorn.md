# **A Public Profile and Network Analysis of Albert Vijghen**

## **Section 1: Executive Profile**

Albert Vijghen presents a multifaceted professional identity rooted in the rigorous analytical framework of econometrics, which he applies to a diverse portfolio of activities spanning corporate consulting, academia, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy. His public-facing professional statement describes his work as having a "human and systems-building focus" aimed at helping "leaders, teams and organizations increase their fundamental value creation" \[LinkedIn\]. This philosophy serves as the central thread connecting his varied roles, which include serving as a Knowledge Modeler for the PNA Group, a Partner at the venture entity N-CV, and the Founder of LemiTree, a personal development initiative.1 His career is built upon a strong academic foundation established at Maastricht University, where he earned advanced degrees and subsequently served as a lecturer.1

The overarching theme of Vijghen's career is the consistent and methodical application of principles derived from his econometric training—namely data analysis, systems thinking, and optimization—to a wide array of complex domains. This approach is evident in his corporate work, where he transforms unstructured knowledge into valuable data assets; in his philanthropic endeavors, where he advocates for data-driven strategies to maximize social impact; and in his personal ventures, which treat individual life and well-being as a system to be understood, balanced, and optimized.

This intellectual consistency suggests that his seemingly disparate roles are not divergent career paths but rather different manifestations of a singular, underlying methodology. At PNA Group, he is tasked with modeling "complex knowledge into structured data," a direct application of systems analysis to a corporate environment.1 In his role with the non-profit A Bethter World, he explicitly champions a data-informed approach to achieve "more impact & less effort," citing evidence that shows certain health interventions yield a higher social return on investment than others.4 This is a classic optimization problem applied to altruism. Concurrently, his personal projects, such as the LemiTree venture and his masterclass titled "A Comfortable Life Worth Living," are centered on "human optimization" and achieving a balanced life through a "holistic and integral approach".1 This framework treats an individual's life as an intricate system that can be methodically improved. His professional trajectory, therefore, is best understood as a continuous effort to identify complex systems—be it a business, a charity, or a human life—and apply structured, evidence-based methods to enhance their performance and fundamental value.

## **Section 2: Intellectual Foundations and Academic Trajectory**

The bedrock of Albert Vijghen's professional and philosophical approach is his formal education and subsequent academic career at Maastricht University. This background in quantitative and theoretical economics provides the essential toolkit that informs his work across all sectors.

### **Educational Background**

Vijghen holds both a Master's degree in Econometrics with a specialization in Mathematical Economics and a Bachelor's degree in International Economics Studies from Maastricht University.1 This rigorous academic training equipped him with a sophisticated understanding of mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and theoretical economic frameworks. His specialization in Mathematical Economics, in particular, indicates a focus on the abstract and formal modeling of economic systems, a skill set that is directly transferable to modeling other complex systems, such as organizational knowledge or personal development frameworks.

### **Academic Role and Expertise**

Following his studies, Vijghen served as a junior lecturer in the macroeconomics department at Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics (SBE).3 During his tenure, he reportedly achieved high evaluation scores, suggesting an effective and well-regarded teaching style.1 His listed areas of expertise on the academic networking platform ResearchGate include Economic Theory, Economic Development, and Growth Economics.6 This focus on macro-level systems and the drivers of long-term growth provides a broad theoretical context for his later work in organizational and human value creation.

Despite his academic position and a public profile on ResearchGate, the available information does not include any formal, peer-reviewed academic publications authored by Vijghen.3 Searches for his name in academic databases yield references to a "Vijghen" in the context of historical studies on colonial Burundi, which, based on the subject matter and listed author initial "I.", are unrelated to Albert Vijghen's profile.7 Other mentions are simple keyword matches on publishing platforms without specific works attributed to him.8

This absence of a traditional publication record, when contrasted with his clear engagement in teaching and mentorship, points toward a professional orientation as a "practitioner-educator" rather than a conventional research academic. His focus appears to be less on generating novel academic research and more on synthesizing, translating, and disseminating existing knowledge into practical, actionable frameworks. This is evidenced by his creation of "simplistic handouts" for his students and his delivery of masterclasses to the public.5 His value proposition lies in his ability to make complex theories from econometrics and other fields accessible and applicable for his students and clients.

### **Pedagogical Philosophy in Practice**

A clear illustration of his pedagogical approach is found in the "quarantine sessions" he co-led for SBE students during the COVID-19 lockdown.10 This voluntary initiative, conducted with his former classmate and fellow teacher Jim Bemelen, was designed to address what they perceived as a critical gap in formal university curricula: "learning how to learn".10

The sessions deliberately moved away from academic theory to focus on holistic, real-world topics such as "sleep, love, exercise and nutrition".10 The methodology involved introducing relevant theories—for example, on wind-down routines to improve sleep—and creating a space for students to experiment with these ideas and reflect on their experiences in a small, open group setting. Vijghen and Bemelen shared their own learning processes, fostering a collaborative and reflective environment.10

This initiative is significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates a deep-seated belief that the student's underlying personal "operating system"—their habits, self-awareness, and well-being—is a crucial prerequisite for effective academic learning. Second, it represents an early, practical application of the "human optimization" philosophy that he would later formalize through his venture, LemiTree. It shows a consistent interest in the mechanics of human flourishing and the use of structured, theory-based interventions to improve it, bridging his academic role with his entrepreneurial and philosophical pursuits. His work as a tutor for the commercial organization Success Formula further cements this identity as an educator active both within and outside formal university structures.11

## **Section 3: Portfolio of Professional and Entrepreneurial Ventures**

Albert Vijghen's professional life is characterized by a portfolio of roles that reflect his core philosophy of systems optimization. He operates as a consultant, an entrepreneur, a project manager, and a venture partner, with each role providing a different arena for applying his analytical framework.

### **3.1. PNA Group**

At PNA Group, a Heerlen-based consultancy specializing in knowledge management, Vijghen holds the title of Knowledge Modeler.1 In this capacity, he utilizes the firm's proprietary CogNIAM® method, a technique designed to "transform complex knowledge into structured data".1 PNA Group's mission is to help organizations with knowledge-intensive challenges establish foundations for the "sustainable and intelligent use of knowledge," thereby preventing the waste of time and resources.1 The firm's client roster includes major organizations such as ABN AMRO, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst), and the European Space Agency.1 This role places Vijghen at the intersection of business intelligence, information management, and organizational strategy, where he applies a rigorous, systematic approach to one of a company's most intangible assets: its collective knowledge.

### **3.2. LemiTree**

Vijghen is the Founder of LemiTree, a venture that focuses on "self-development tactics for human optimization".1 This entity appears to be the formal business vehicle for the philosophical and pedagogical ideas he has developed throughout his career. The concepts underpinning LemiTree are articulated in his public-speaking engagements, such as the masterclass titled "A Comfortable Life Worth Living".5 In this lecture, he addresses the modern challenge of information and choice overload, offering a "holistic and integral approach" to help individuals filter information, determine what is right for them, and implement it in their daily lives to avoid burnout and regret.5 The philosophy of LemiTree is a direct extension of the themes explored in the "quarantine sessions," focusing on practical, life-improving strategies grounded in theory.10

It is critical to note that LemiTree is a distinct and unrelated entity to several other businesses with similar names. Public records and searches reveal companies such as LeMaitre Vascular, a publicly traded American medical device company founded by Dr. George D. LeMaitre 12; Lemaitre Sécurité, a French manufacturer of safety footwear 13; and other "LeMaitre" branded businesses.14 There is no evidence connecting Albert Vijghen's LemiTree to any of these entities, nor to the famed Belgian physicist and priest Georges Lemaître.16 No public website for Vijghen's LemiTree was identified in the available information, which may indicate it operates as a personal consultancy or is a project in an early stage of development.

### **3.3. BronzGreen Bee**

Vijghen is also the Co-Founder of BronzGreen Bee.1 This venture is part of the larger BronzGreen entity, which aims to help organizations "floureren door ze te helpen bij het intelligent digitaliseren en duurzaam & mensgericht organiseren" (flourish by helping them with intelligent digitalization and sustainable & human-centered organizing).17 This mission aligns perfectly with Vijghen's focus on systems, data, and human-centric value creation.

BronzGreen Bee B.V. is a registered Dutch company with a physical address in Voerendaal and a contact phone number.18 Public records connect Max Grispen to BronzGreen Bee in Maastricht, identifying him as a key associate in the venture.19 The branding for the company, including its logo and promotional flyers, was created by designer Bas Göbbels.20 This venture represents a concrete entrepreneurial application of Vijghen's core principles in a commercial consulting context.

### **3.4. OperaSana**

Within the organization OperaSana, Vijghen is listed as the Project Manager of "TRIBE".1 OperaSana's primary business is "Meten en monitoren in werkgeversvitaliteit" (Measuring and monitoring in employer vitality), suggesting a focus on corporate wellness and employee health metrics.21 This is further supported by the existence of a related entity, Stichting Quality Control on Vitality, which lists operasana.eu as its website and whose purpose includes management consulting and preventive healthcare.22

The nature of the "TRIBE" project is not defined in the available materials. The name is highly generic, and broad searches for this term lead to a significant number of unrelated projects, primarily concerning U.S. tribal energy, environmental, and sovereignty initiatives funded by government agencies.23 There is no evidence to connect Vijghen or OperaSana to these U.S.-based tribal projects. It is highly probable that "TRIBE" is an internal project name within OperaSana, related to its work in employer vitality, and that the external search results are coincidental red herrings.

### **3.5. N-CV**

One of Vijghen's most strategically significant affiliations is his role as a Partner at an entity identified as "N-CV".2 This position is documented through his inclusion in the SystAIn3r community, an ecosystem of "visionary experts and innovators" organized by J3D.AI.2 This community is explicitly curated for "the top 0.1% of global leaders" and focuses on scaling solutions in high-impact sectors including AI, Cyber, Quantum, Web3, Space Tech, Longevity, and Climate Tech.2 Events like the J3D.AI House of Collaboration in Davos are designed for leaders with the "power, influence, and drive to shape the future of humanity".28

The designation "Partner" implies a senior, decision-making role, far more significant than that of a simple community member or affiliate. While the acronym "N-CV" is ambiguous and could correspond to multiple unrelated businesses in fields like real estate or IT consulting 29, the context of the SystAIn3r community provides a strong directional indicator. One entity, New Climate Ventures (NCV), aligns perfectly with the community's focus. New Climate Ventures is a venture capital firm that "invests in innovative early-stage startups with a focus on decarbonization" and is incubating its own climate technology startup.32

Connecting these points leads to a high-probability hypothesis that Vijghen's role as Partner at N-CV is with New Climate Ventures or a similarly focused deep tech or climate tech venture capital firm. This affiliation marks a potential major pivot or expansion in his career, moving him from academia and consulting into the world of venture capital and early-stage technology investment. It reframes his profile from one of static expertise to one of forward-looking strategic engagement with transformative technologies.

## **Section 4: Philanthropic and Educational Initiatives**

Albert Vijghen's non-commercial activities provide a clear window into his personal motivations and demonstrate the practical application of his core philosophies in the realms of social impact and education.

### **4.1. A Bethter World**

Vijghen serves as the Secretary to the Board for the non-profit foundation A Bethter World.1 He works alongside Founder and Chairman Thomas Leruth and Treasurer Florian Knaeple.4 This leadership team shares a common background in education and ties to Maastricht, with Leruth having founded a tutoring organization and Knaeple pursuing a Ph.D. at Maastricht University.4

Within this organization, Vijghen's contribution is a clear embodiment of his data-driven, optimization-focused mindset. He articulates his personal vision with the slogan "more impact & less effort" and states his role is to provide the charity with "reliable data" to guide its decisions.4 He offers a compelling example of this philosophy in action: while the group holds education in high regard, he points out that "the data show that factors such as countering malnutrition in young children as well as deworming them provides the most social return for every euro invested".4 This statement is a textbook application of the principles of effective altruism, where philanthropic resources are allocated based on empirical evidence of impact rather than emotional appeal or pre-existing passions. It showcases his econometric thinking being used to solve for the highest possible social return on investment.

### **4.2. "Quarantine Sessions" and Tutoring**

Vijghen's commitment to education extends beyond his formal role at the university into voluntary and commercial domains. His collaboration with Jim Bemelen on the "quarantine sessions" for students was a pro-bono initiative born from a shared passion for improving how students learn.10 The project's focus on meta-learning ("learning how to learn") and holistic well-being (sleep, nutrition, exercise) served as a practical laboratory for the "human optimization" ideas he champions.10 By compiling information and creating "simplistic handouts," he acted as a synthesizer and translator of complex information, helping students apply these theories to their own lives.10

In addition to this voluntary work, Vijghen is also listed as a tutor for Success Formula, a commercial tutoring service.11 This affiliation, combined with his university lecturing and non-profit work, paints a picture of a dedicated educator who engages with students across multiple platforms, from formal institutional settings to personalized, practical coaching.

## **Section 5: Analysis of Public Network and Collaborations**

An analysis of Albert Vijghen's publicly documented network reveals distinct but interconnected clusters of associates that correspond to the different facets of his career. These clusters span a local academic and philanthropic community in Maastricht, a set of entrepreneurial partners, and an emerging global network of high-level technologists and investors.

## **Section 6: Synthesis and Strategic Insights**

A comprehensive analysis of Albert Vijghen's public profile reveals a highly integrated professional identity, a clear evolutionary trajectory in his network, and a strategic positioning that points toward significant future influence at the intersection of technology, systems thinking, and human potential.

### **The Integrated Professional Identity**

The three primary personas identified—The Econometrician, The Entrepreneur, and The Human Optimization Philosopher—are not separate roles but are deeply interwoven facets of a single, coherent professional identity. His econometric training provides the fundamental methodology—the 'how'—which is characterized by data analysis, systems modeling, and a drive for optimization. His entrepreneurial ventures, from PNA Group to BronzGreen Bee, provide the practical arenas—the 'what'—where this methodology is applied to solve real-world business problems. Finally, his human optimization philosophy, expressed through LemiTree and his educational initiatives, provides the ultimate purpose—the 'why'—which is the enhancement of fundamental value, whether for an organization, a society, or an individual. This synthesis explains how he can seamlessly move between modeling corporate knowledge, calculating the ROI of a charity, and teaching students about sleep hygiene; to him, they are all complex systems that can be understood and improved through a structured, analytical lens.

### **Analysis of Network Value and Trajectory**

Vijghen's network demonstrates a clear and strategic evolution. It originates from a strong, localized base in Maastricht, comprising academic colleagues, non-profit board members, and local business partners.4 This cluster represents his intellectual and foundational roots. However, his more recent affiliations indicate a deliberate and significant expansion into a global, high-value network of technologists, innovators, and investors.

His role as a "Partner at N-CV" and his participation in the exclusive J3D.AI / SystAIn3r community are the most critical data points for understanding his current and future trajectory.2 This move places him far beyond the confines of a regional academic or consultant and into an international ecosystem where discussions revolve around scaling transformative technologies in sectors like AI, longevity, and climate tech.2 This network is not merely a collection of contacts but a platform for influence, investment, and co-creation at a global level.

### **Forward-Looking Perspective**

Based on the available evidence, Albert Vijghen is positioning himself as a bridge between the quantitative, analytical world of econometrics and the forward-looking, high-stakes world of deep technology and venture capital. His unique combination of skills—the ability to model complex systems, a deep interest in human potential, and a demonstrated capacity for translating theory into practice—makes him a valuable asset in this new context.

His future trajectory is most strongly indicated by the "Partner at N-CV" title. This suggests a move into roles where he can apply his systems-thinking approach to evaluate, guide, and invest in early-stage technology companies. Potential future roles could include:

* **A Venture Partner or Principal** at a firm like New Climate Ventures, specializing in assessing the systemic viability and potential impact of climate tech or human-centric technology startups.  
* **A Strategic Consultant or Advisor** for deep tech companies, helping them model their growth, structure their internal knowledge, and build sustainable, human-centered organizations.  
* **The Founder of a new venture** that directly merges his human optimization framework with emerging technologies like AI to create data-driven personal development platforms.

In conclusion, Albert Vijghen is a subject whose professional arc is ascending. Having built a solid foundation in academia and consulting, he is now leveraging that expertise to engage with a global network of innovators. His activities suggest a clear ambition to move beyond analysis and education and into a more active role in shaping the future by investing in and building the next generation of technology-driven, value-creating enterprises. He is a subject whose influence and activities warrant continued observation, particularly within the venture capital and climate tech sectors.
