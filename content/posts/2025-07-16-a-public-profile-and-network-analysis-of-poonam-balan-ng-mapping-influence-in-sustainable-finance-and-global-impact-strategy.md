# **A Public Profile and Network Analysis of Poonam Balan-Ng: Mapping Influence in Sustainable Finance and Global Impact Strategy**

## **Section 1: Executive Profile**

Poonam Balan-Ng has established herself as a global impact leader, cross-sectoral strategist, and entrepreneur with a specialized focus on sustainable finance, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) integration, and the transformation of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Her professional background is notably international, with a career arc that encompasses corporate finance in Canada, public sector strategic consulting in Malaysia, and entrepreneurial leadership within Europe's burgeoning CleanTech and impact investment sectors.1 This diverse experience has positioned her at the nexus of finance, policy, and social impact.

Her current primary roles reflect the culmination of this experience. She is the Founding Partner and Chief Strategist of TACT+INVEST Group, a Berlin-based ESG impact investment firm poised to launch in 2024\. Concurrently, she operates TACT+HUB, a risk management and impact strategy consultancy she founded, and serves as the Chairperson for Diversity is POWER, a non-profit organization based in New York City.1 These positions demonstrate a strategic focus on both direct capital allocation for impact and high-level advisory and governance.

Ms. Balan-Ng's core expertise is situated at the intersection of financial risk management, brand integrity strategy, digital transformation, and regulatory compliance. She has garnered recognition for her proficiency in de-risking capital investments in emerging economies and for her work in designing and implementing robust governance frameworks for both public and private sector entities.2 Among her notable distinctions are the CIBC Achievers Award, earned for her contributions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis; significant work advancing the impact investing initiatives of the Clinton Global Initiative; and a recent appointment as the first Carbon Fund Advisory Board member of the International Green Technologies and Investment Projects Center (IGTIPC) of Kazakhstan.2

An analysis of Ms. Balan-Ng's career reveals a professional archetype that functions as a "translator" between disparate but increasingly interconnected worlds. Her trajectory shows a deliberate progression through the distinct domains of traditional corporate finance, governmental policy-making, and mission-driven social impact. This journey began in the structured environment of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), where she gained foundational experience in risk and corporate governance.1 It then moved to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP), immersing her in the world of social enterprise and development finance.2 Her subsequent role at TalentCorp Malaysia placed her inside a government agency, providing direct experience with national policy formulation.1 Finally, her entrepreneurial ventures in Europe, TACT+HUB and TACT+INVEST, represent the synthesis of these experiences.4

This unique combination of skills and experiences allows her to bridge the communication and operational gaps that often exist between these sectors. She possesses the formal credentials of a financial professional, including Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and Sustainability and Climate Risk (SCR) certifications from the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP), enabling her to speak the language of risk and return with CFOs and institutional investors.1 Simultaneously, her background in "Public Private Partnership Impact Branding" and "Governmental Tri-Sector Panel strategy" equips her to navigate the complex stakeholder environments of public sector initiatives.1 Her own professional branding underscores this capability, emphasizing a "cross-sectoral brand integrity strategy with public, private, and social interests".1 This ability to translate the objectives, constraints, and language of one sector to another makes her a critical node in the ecosystem of sustainable development, capable of structuring complex initiatives that satisfy the demands of diverse stakeholders.

## **Section 2: Professional Trajectory: A Global Career in Impact and Transformation**

The professional history of Poonam Balan-Ng is characterized by a series of strategic pivots across continents and sectors, each phase building upon the last to create a unique and specialized skill set. Her career can be analyzed in three distinct stages: foundational roles in North American corporate and non-profit sectors, strategic public and private consulting in Asia, and entrepreneurial leadership in Europe's impact economy.

### **2.1. Early Career Foundations in North America (c. 2005-2012)**

Ms. Balan-Ng's early career began in Vancouver, Canada, with roles that provided a strong foundation in high-level client relations and corporate operations. From 2005 to 2007, she served as a Front Office Manager and Fairmont Gold \- Concierge at Fairmont Hotels & Resorts. In this capacity, she managed private lounge services for "eminent guests" and was noted as the first and youngest individual hired for the Fairmont Gold program without prior Fairmont training.1 This position would have honed skills in discretion, bespoke service delivery, and managing the expectations of high-profile clientele—competencies that would prove valuable in her later work with donors and senior executives.

In 2007, she transitioned to the financial sector, joining the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), where she remained until late 2010\. Her roles included Sr. Regional Administration and Executive Support to the VP of Cheque & Currency Processing.1 This period was particularly formative as it coincided with the 2008 global financial crisis, providing a real-world education in corporate governance and risk management under extreme pressure. It was at CIBC that she demonstrated an early aptitude for integrating social and environmental concerns into a corporate framework. She founded the bank's regional "Greening Committee" and led corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, helping CIBC surpass its fundraising targets tenfold.1 These efforts contributed to her receiving the CIBC Achievers Award for 2008-2009.1

A definitive pivot toward global impact occurred in late 2010 when she joined the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP), an initiative of the Clinton Foundation. As Executive Assistant to the Managing Director until December 2012, she was deeply involved in the operational core of the social business builder. Her responsibilities included donor relationship management, external audit coordination, public relations, and partnership analysis.1 This role marked a clear transition from traditional finance into the specialized field of impact investing, focusing on market-based solutions to poverty alleviation in emerging economies.3

### **2.2. Public Sector and Strategic Consulting in Asia (c. 2013-2018)**

Following her time in North America, Ms. Balan-Ng relocated to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where she applied her skills to public sector strategy and private sector consulting. From December 2013 to December 2015, she served as the Head of Digital Strategy, Global Malaysian Talent Facilitation, and Diversity & Inclusion at Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp), an agency operating under the Prime Minister's Unit.1 Her leadership in engagement strategies and talent data analysis was described as "crucial in defining GNI targets, talent retention, and labor economic policies".2 This role was instrumental in strengthening her reputation in Government-to-Government (G2G) governance, particularly through her work establishing digital performance metrics and Request for Proposal (RFP) standards.2

Concurrently and subsequently, she engaged with the education sector. From December 2015 to January 2017, she was a Founding Member of CSR Strategy and Head of Strategic Development at the BAC Education Group. Her work there focused on Public-Private Partnership impact branding and developing the data architecture and growth strategy for EduNation, a free online learning platform.1 To further formalize and disseminate her expertise, she served as an Industry Lecturer at IACT College from 2015 to 2016\. In this capacity, she designed and delivered syllabi for final-year mass communication students on topics including Investor Relations, Impact Investing, and CSR Strategy, effectively training the next generation of professionals in her specialized field.1

Her final major role in Asia was with Tranglo, a cross-border payment specialist, from January 2017 to October 2018\. Initially serving as Group Brand Impact Strategist, she consulted for the MBI holding group on organizational brand and communications strategy. She was later appointed VP of Brand and PR for PAVOCOMMS, a subsidiary of MBI, demonstrating her ability to lead brand and PR functions within a complex corporate structure.1

### **2.3. Entrepreneurial Leadership in Europe's Impact Sector (c. 2019-Present)**

Ms. Balan-Ng's most recent career phase has been centered in Berlin, Germany, and is marked by entrepreneurial leadership. This phase appears to operate under the umbrella of Legacy Incorporated, her personal consulting brand established in 2015, through which she offers a suite of services including brand integrity strategy, reputation risk management, and sustainability disclosure frameworks.1

In June 2019, she formalized her advisory practice by founding TACT+HUB, where she serves as Founder & Chief Strategist. TACT+HUB is a risk management consultancy that assists organizations and startups in developing social and climate-conscious brand and impact strategies.1

This advisory work culminated in the co-founding of TACT+INVEST Group in November 2023\. As Founding Partner and Chief Strategist, she is now directly involved in deploying capital through an ESG-focused impact investment group. This venture represents the synthesis of her entire career, leveraging her expertise in finance, policy, and impact to guide investment decisions designed to create measurable, positive change.1

In a parallel move that reconnects with her focus on talent and inclusion, she assumed the role of Chairperson for the NYC-based non-profit Diversity is POWER in August 2024\. A key initiative under her leadership is the launch of a Global Talent Catalyst Fund, which aims to create remote and hybrid jobs with a focus on diaspora communities and underrepresented talent pools.1

The progression of Ms. Balan-Ng's career suggests not a series of disconnected jobs, but the deliberate architecting of a highly specialized professional niche. Each stage appears to have been strategically chosen to acquire a specific set of skills, experiences, and networks essential for the next. The first phase in North America provided the foundational financial acumen and an introduction to high-level impact work. Her time at CIBC offered a deep understanding of corporate governance and risk within a major financial institution, particularly during a period of crisis.1 This was followed by immersion in the world of social enterprise and development finance at the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, providing exposure to PPP models and poverty alleviation strategies in emerging markets.5 The second phase in Asia added a crucial layer of public sector and governance expertise. Her work at TalentCorp Malaysia offered a rare, insider's perspective on the formulation of national economic policy and G2G strategy, a viewpoint seldom held by private-sector actors.2 The final and current phase in Europe represents the synthesis and capitalization of this accumulated knowledge. By founding TACT+HUB and TACT+INVEST, she has transitioned from employee and consultant to founder and capital allocator, leveraging her unique tripartite expertise in finance, development, and policy to build her own ventures. This trajectory indicates a long-term strategic vision to construct a career profile that is difficult to replicate, positioning her as an authority in the complex, multi-stakeholder field of blended finance and sustainable development.

## **Section 3: Core Competencies and Thematic Expertise**

Poonam Balan-Ng's professional value is defined by a set of intersecting core competencies that she has cultivated throughout her global career. These areas of expertise allow her to operate effectively across the public, private, and social sectors, addressing complex challenges in sustainability and finance.

### **3.1. Sustainable Finance, ESG, and Impact Investing**

This domain represents the central pillar of Ms. Balan-Ng's expertise. Her work is deeply rooted in the principles of sustainable finance, focusing on ESG integration into investment processes, the development of robust impact measurement frameworks, and the structuring of blended finance solutions that leverage both public and private capital. Her authority in this area is substantiated by professional certifications in Sustainability and Climate Risk (SCR) and as a Financial Risk Manager (FRM) from the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP).1 This formal training in risk provides a quantitative and analytical foundation to her approach. Her current role as Founding Partner of TACT+INVEST, an ESG impact investment group, is the clearest manifestation of this competency.4 Furthermore, her work as an industry lecturer on impact investing and her frequent media appearances as an expert on ESG confirm this as her primary professional focus.1

### **3.2. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and G2G Governance**

A key differentiator in Ms. Balan-Ng's profile is her deep, hands-on experience with public-private partnerships and government-to-government governance models. Her tenure at TalentCorp Malaysia, where she consulted on national talent and economic policy from within a government unit, provided her with invaluable insights into the mechanics of public sector decision-making.2 This experience is complemented by her work at the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which specialized in creating market-based social enterprises in developing countries, a quintessential form of PPP.5 Her biography explicitly highlights her experience in "leading public consultation roles for emerging economies" and her achievement in pioneering an SDG impact scorecard for sport innovation in collaboration with major global governance bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UEFA.2 This dual perspective allows her to effectively design and manage initiatives that require seamless collaboration between government bodies and private enterprise.

### **3.3. Brand Integrity, Risk Management, and Digital Transformation**

A consistent theme woven throughout Ms. Balan-Ng's career is the critical link between brand value, operational integrity, and risk management. Her consulting work through Legacy Incorporated and TACT+HUB explicitly offers services in "Reputation Risk Management" and "Corporate Communication".1 This focus was evident early in her career, as her CIBC Achievers Award recognized contributions to "Corporate Governance" and "Continuous Improvement".1 Her role at Tranglo involved leading a comprehensive brand and PR restructuring for a holding group and its subsidiary.1 She understands that in the modern economy, a company's brand and reputation are inextricably linked to its ethical conduct, its management of social and environmental risks, and its ability to adapt through digital transformation.

### **3.4. CleanTech, DeepTech, and Diaspora-Driven Economics**

A more recent but increasingly significant area of focus is the application of her strategic skills to technology-driven sectors and innovative economic models. Her recent advisory roles for CleanTech companies such as Fossil Free Marine, where she focused on biofuel infrastructure and ESG integration, and OUR GREENERY, demonstrate a direct engagement with the green technology startup ecosystem.1 Her biography also notes her leadership in Europe's CleanTech and DeepTech sectors over the past eight years.2 A particularly unique strategic angle is her focus on "Diaspora-driven legacy in economics".2 This is materialized through her work as Chairperson of Diversity is POWER and its Global Talent Catalyst Fund, which aims to leverage global diaspora communities as a source of talent and capital for economic development, particularly in the Global South.9

A defining characteristic of Ms. Balan-Ng's approach to this work is her foundation in risk management. While many professionals in the impact space come from a social or environmental background, her perspective is shaped by the rigorous, quantitative discipline of financial risk. Her dual FRM and SCR certifications are not incidental; they are central to her professional identity.1 This "risk-first" methodology is evident throughout her career. Her award at CIBC was won for improving governance and restructuring administration during the 2008 financial crisis, a period defined by catastrophic failures in risk management across the global financial industry.1 Her current work is explicitly focused on developing "de-risking strategies in emerging economies".2 This framing is strategically significant. It allows her to communicate the value of sustainability and impact not merely as a moral imperative or a philanthropic exercise, but as a critical component of long-term financial risk mitigation and value preservation. By presenting ESG as an essential tool for managing regulatory, reputational, climate-related, and operational risks, she makes the concept more urgent and palatable for mainstream corporate boards and traditional investors, effectively translating the language of impact into the language of financial prudence.

## **Section 4: Notable Achievements and Public Recognition**

Poonam Balan-Ng's career is marked by several publicly documented achievements and recognitions that validate her expertise and influence in her respective fields. These accomplishments span corporate awards, pioneering work in impact measurement, and appointments to significant advisory roles.

* **CIBC Achievers Award (2008-2009):** During her tenure at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Ms. Balan-Ng was a recipient of the CIBC Achievers Award. This recognition was granted for her contributions in the areas of continuous improvement, corporate governance, employee satisfaction transformation, and restructuring administration.1 The award is particularly noteworthy given its timing during the global financial crisis, a period of intense pressure and scrutiny for financial institutions. Her biography further specifies that the award recognized her success in "integrating productivity and greening policies," highlighting her early ability to merge operational efficiency with sustainability objectives.2  
* **Advancing Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Initiatives:** Her role at the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP) involved direct contributions to advancing the organization's impact investing initiatives.3 CGEP was established to create and scale social enterprises as a means of poverty alleviation.6 In addition to her work within the initiative, she leveraged her corporate connections to further social goals. While at CGEP, she spearheaded donor commitments to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which enabled her former employer, CIBC, to surpass its CSR fundraising targets by a factor of ten.2  
* **Pioneering SDG Impact Scorecard:** A significant and innovative achievement is her role in pioneering "the first SDG impact scorecard for Sport Innovation in over 30 countries with WHO and UEFA".2 This accomplishment represents a concrete contribution to the field of impact measurement, a critical challenge within the sustainability sector. Developing a standardized scorecard for measuring contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in partnership with globally recognized bodies like the World Health Organization and the Union of European Football Associations demonstrates a high level of innovation and the ability to manage complex, multi-stakeholder projects.  
* **Appointment to IGTIPC Carbon Fund Advisory Board:** Ms. Balan-Ng was appointed as the "first Carbon Fund Advisory Board member of Kazakhstan's International Green Technologies and Investment Projects Center (IGTIPC)".2 This appointment serves as a strong external validation of her expertise in green technology, carbon neutrality, and sustainable finance. Being selected for such a role by a national-level entity tasked with advancing a country's green agenda underscores her international standing as a leader in the field.  
* **G2G Governance and Policy Influence in Malaysia:** During her time at TalentCorp Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister's Unit, her work had a direct impact on national policy. Her leadership in developing engagement strategies and leveraging talent data was described as "crucial in defining GNI targets, talent retention, and labor economic policies".2 This level of involvement in shaping a nation's economic and human capital strategy is a significant achievement, demonstrating her capacity to influence policy at the highest levels of government.

## **Section 5: Current Ventures and Strategic Focus**

Poonam Balan-Ng's current professional activities are concentrated in three primary ventures that represent the synthesis of her career experience: an impact investment group, a specialized consultancy, and a non-profit organization. These roles, supplemented by targeted strategic advisory work, define her present focus on deploying capital, strategy, and talent for sustainable development.

### **5.1. TACT+INVEST Group**

TACT+INVEST Group is a Berlin-based ESG impact investment firm that Ms. Balan-Ng co-founded in November 2023\. The group's stated mission is to create "measurable impact throughout value chains while adhering to responsible investing principles".1 It has set an ambitious target of achieving a greater than 95% Targeted Impact Investment Ratio across its portfolio.4 As the Founding Partner and Chief Strategist, Ms. Balan-Ng is responsible for guiding the firm's overarching investment strategy. This likely involves leading deal sourcing, conducting due diligence on potential investments, and structuring deals to ensure they meet both financial and impact mandates. Her role also involves ensuring portfolio-wide compliance with diverse and complex standards, including ESG frameworks, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and principles of Shari'a or Sukuk-compliant investment strategies.2 Her key associate and co-founder in this venture is

**Sascha Preis**, who serves as the General Partner and Chief Technologist. Mr. Preis's background as a former Head of Innovation in Production for Mercedes Benz brings deep technical and hardware development expertise to the partnership.4

### **5.2. TACT+HUB**

Founded in June 2019, TACT+HUB is the vehicle for Ms. Balan-Ng's risk management and advisory services. As Founder and Chief Strategist, she provides consulting to organizations and startups aiming to "build social and/or climate conscious brand & impact strategies".7 This entity appears to function as her personal consultancy, allowing her to take on strategic advisory projects that may fall outside the specific investment thesis of TACT+INVEST Group. It leverages her expertise in risk management, brand integrity, and ESG integration to guide clients.1

### **5.3. Diversity is POWER**

In August 2024, Ms. Balan-Ng took on the role of Chairperson for Diversity is POWER, a non-profit organization based in New York City. The organization's mission is to support community-based initiatives through research, collaboration, and educational programming in a nonpartisan manner.1 A flagship initiative under her leadership is the "Global Talent Catalyst Fund," which aims to create 10,000 remote and hybrid jobs globally. The fund has a specific focus on empowering diaspora communities, women, and underrepresented talent pools across the Global South and major global cities.9 This role aligns directly with her long-standing professional interest in diaspora-driven economics and inclusive talent strategies, themes that were central to her work at TalentCorp Malaysia.1

### **5.4. Recent Strategic Advisory Roles**

In the period leading up to the launch of TACT+INVEST, Ms. Balan-Ng held several short-term, high-impact advisory roles with early-stage CleanTech ventures, demonstrating her hands-on approach to fostering innovation in the sector.

* **Fossil Free Marine (November 2023 – April 2024):** She served as a Strategic Growth Advisor for this Stockholm-based company. Her responsibilities included market activation for marine biofuel infrastructure, identifying pilot zones and scaling opportunities, and integrating ESG principles into the company's growth strategy.1  
* **OUR GREENERY (October 2023 – February 2024):** As a Strategic Advisor for this Berlin-based startup, she focused on financial review, market growth strategy, and the adoption of ESG disclosure practices.1

These recent advisory positions illustrate her direct application of expertise to help nascent sustainable technology companies navigate the complex challenges of financing, market entry, and regulatory compliance.

### **Detailed Network Context and Analysis**

#### **Inner Circle \- Business Partnership (TACT+INVEST)**

The most significant and operationally critical relationship in Ms. Balan-Ng's current network is with **Sascha Preis**, her co-founder at TACT+INVEST Group.4 This partnership appears highly synergistic and strategically designed. Ms. Balan-Ng provides the expertise in financial strategy, risk management, ESG frameworks, and public-private dynamics. Mr. Preis, with his background as a former Head of Innovation at Mercedes Benz, contributes deep technical knowledge in scaled production, hardware development, and Industry 4.0.4 This fusion of financial and engineering acumen creates a venture group uniquely positioned to evaluate and invest in the complex DeepTech and CleanTech sectors, where understanding both the ESG impact case and the underlying technology is paramount. This partnership allows them to bridge the common gap between "soft" impact strategy and "hard" technological viability.

#### **Media and Thought Leadership Network**

Ms. Balan-Ng's appearances on the "Innovation Fika" vodcast, hosted by **Donnie SC Lygonis**, are noteworthy.7 Mr. Lygonis is an Innovation Strategist at Sweden's prestigious KTH Royal Institute of Technology, a key institution in the European innovation landscape.11 These collaborations, focusing on topics like Women in Venture Capital and ESG Investing, serve to position Ms. Balan-Ng as a subject matter expert within the influential Nordic innovation ecosystem, which is a global leader in sustainability and technology. This relationship is a channel for disseminating her thought leadership and building her public profile.

#### **High-Profile Global Networks (Clinton Initiative & Conference Circuits)**

Her early-career role at the **Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership** (2010-2012) provided foundational access to a high-level global network. This placed her within the operational orbit of global figures like President **Bill Clinton** and philanthropist **Frank Giustra**, as well as senior executives of the initiative like CEO **Mark Gunton**.1 While her position was as an Executive Assistant, this experience would have provided invaluable exposure to the workings of elite global initiatives and access to a network of influential individuals in development, policy, and finance.

More recently, her status as a regular speaker at major international conferences like **GITEX Impact** in the UAE and **SuperBridge Dubai** serves to maintain and expand this high-caliber network.2 These engagements place her on the same platform as a diverse array of global leaders. This includes C-suite executives of major corporations and investment holdings (Jalal Gasimov of PASHA Holding, Sky Kurtz of Pure Harvest), senior bankers and influential financial figures (Maher Al Kaabi of Alserkal Group, Aldo L. Romani, formerly of the EIB), Nobel Laureates (Lameen Abdul-Malik), and prominent cultural ambassadors (Rocky Dawuni).2 While these connections are likely affiliations of professional peerage rather than deep collaborations, they are strategically important. They enhance her visibility, validate her expertise on a global stage, and provide access to a broad and powerful network of decision-makers.

#### **Network Gaps and Limitations**

It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis, which is based exclusively on publicly available information. The user query requested information on friends and associates beyond a purely professional context, but the available data does not provide insight into personal friendships, informal mentorships, or private investment partners. The public record is heavily skewed towards formal organizational affiliations and public appearances.

Furthermore, while senior leadership at her former employers can be identified (e.g., **Nazrul Aziz** at TalentCorp, **Raja Singham** at BAC Education), the specific day-to-day colleagues with whom she directly collaborated are not documented in the provided materials.14 Similarly, the board members of the non-profit she chairs, Diversity is POWER, are not publicly listed beyond her own role as Chairperson.9 These represent gaps inherent in any analysis reliant on public data and underscore the distinction between a public profile and a private due diligence investigation.
