The analysis synthesizes publicly available information regarding her biographical background, professional achievements, the operational context of Sequentum, and her documented network of associates and collaborators.

Sarah McKenna brings over two decades of experience from New York City's technology scene ("Silicon Alley") to her leadership role at Sequentum.1 A graduate of Georgetown University 1, she transitioned from an initial career in finance to technology, developing deep expertise in quality assurance (QA) and large-scale, data-driven automated operations within early dot-com environments.4 This technical foundation in ensuring data trustworthiness and operational reliability appears central to her leadership approach and aligns directly with Sequentum's market positioning. Before joining Sequentum, McKenna played roles in guiding several technology companies, including Summit Systems, Vitech, and Massive Incorporated, towards successful acquisitions by major players like Misys, CVC Capital Partners, and Microsoft, respectively.4

As CEO of Sequentum, McKenna oversees the company's growth in software, data services, and data products.1 Sequentum, backed by WorldQuant Ventures 1, provides enterprise-grade web data extraction solutions, including its Sequentum Enterprise software, managed data services, and the cloud-based SaaS platform, Sequentum Cloud.5 The company targets corporate, financial, and government clients requiring high-quality, reliable, and compliant alternative data for critical decision-making.4 Under McKenna's leadership, Sequentum has emphasized the development and promotion of industry standards for ethical and compliant web data collection, notably through her role as Technical Advisor for the SIIA Financial Information Standards Division (FISD) Alt Data Council's Web Data Collection Considerations.4 Key milestones during her tenure include the launch of Sequentum Cloud and the Sequentum Marketplace for Intelligent Agents 5, achieving SOC-2 accreditation 10, and receiving industry recognition such as the CIOReview 2024 Enterprise Data Delivery Platform of the Year award.10

## **II. Biographical Profile: Sarah (Ransom) McKenna**

### **A. Educational Background**

Sarah McKenna's formal education includes graduation from Georgetown University.1 The available public information does not specify the degree obtained or her year of graduation. This affiliation with a prestigious university provides a strong academic underpinning to her extensive career in technology and finance.

Additionally, McKenna has engaged with the educational community in other capacities. She has addressed and encouraged students at Choate Rosemary Hall, advising them to "Follow your curiosity".13 While this interaction suggests an affinity or connection, the provided sources do not confirm whether she is an alumna of Choate Rosemary Hall. Such engagements often occur at institutions with which individuals have personal or professional ties, hinting at potential broader network connections within the educational sphere, although this remains unconfirmed by the available data.

### **B. Pre-Sequentum Career and Technology Sector Experience**

McKenna possesses a substantial career spanning over 20 years within New York City's technology sector, often referred to as "Silicon Alley".1 Her professional journey began in finance before she strategically pivoted to join an early dot-com organization, marking the start of her extensive involvement in technology.4 This transition reflects an early recognition of the burgeoning digital economy and an adaptability crucial for navigating rapidly evolving industries.

Her leadership experience is notably diverse, encompassing a wide array of technology verticals. She has held roles in adtech, edtech, fintech, healthtech, sectech, and gaming, before focusing more recently on web data extraction, big data, and analytics.2 This breadth of experience across different business models and technological applications likely provides her with a comprehensive understanding of the varied data needs and challenges faced by Sequentum's diverse clientele, which includes corporate, financial, and government entities.4

Prior to her current role as CEO of Sequentum, McKenna contributed significantly to the success of several notable data technology companies. Her career includes involvement with Summit Systems, which was later acquired by Misys; Vitech, subsequently acquired by CVC Capital Partners; and Massive Incorporated, which was acquired by Microsoft.4 Her work history also includes time at QL2 Software.14 Her association with companies that achieved successful, high-profile exits underscores her experience in environments focused on scaling operations, creating strategic value, and navigating the complexities of mergers and acquisitions â€“ all highly relevant experiences for leading a growth-oriented technology firm like Sequentum.

### **C. Expertise Development**

A defining aspect of Sarah McKenna's career is the early development of specialized expertise in quality assurance (QA) and large-scale, data-driven automated operations.4 This skill set was honed during her time at an early dot-com organization, laying the groundwork for her subsequent achievements. Quality assurance emphasizes reliability, accuracy, and correctness, while automation focuses on efficiency and scalability. The combination of these disciplines within data-driven operations creates a powerful competency, particularly relevant in fields like web data extraction where data quality and volume are paramount.

This technical foundation is consistently linked to her track record of success, particularly in delivering "trustworthy results in lean bleeding edge startups".1 Operating effectively in such high-pressure, resource-constrained environments demonstrates an ability to apply rigorous QA and automation principles pragmatically.

This core competency appears to be more than just a part of her history; it forms a foundational element of her leadership philosophy and directly informs Sequentum's strategic direction. The company's consistent emphasis on providing "trustworthy," "reliable," "high-quality," and "compliant" data solutions 1 strongly reflects McKenna's background. This focus on trustworthy automation and quality assurance has been credited with fueling Sequentum's evolution from a niche web scraping entity into a broader software provider for the data movement space.4 It also positions the company effectively in the often complex and scrutinized market of web data extraction, differentiating its offerings as enterprise-grade and ethically grounded. This technical credibility likely underpins her effectiveness in leading industry-wide efforts to establish best practices and standards.1

## **III. Sequentum: Company Context**

### **A. Business Overview**

Sequentum operates as a prominent provider of web data extraction solutions, specializing in delivering high-quality, custom, alternative datasets tailored for corporate, financial, and government clients.4 Its services are designed to support informed decision-making and mission-critical analysis by transforming vast amounts of public web data into structured, actionable intelligence.4

Testimonials from clients like Innodata Inc., Collective Marketing Solutions, and Retail Insight, LLC highlight the perceived effectiveness and advanced capabilities of Sequentum's solutions.7

### **B. Industry Standing, Funding, and History**

Sequentum is presented as a data industry leader with a significant history, frequently citing over 15 years of experience in web data extraction and automation technologies.4 However, there are discrepancies in publicly available records regarding its founding date. Sources variously report the founding year as 2006 (naming Soren Mondrup as founder) 6, 2008 16, and 2014.15 Given the consistent claim of "over 15 years" of leadership (as of 2024), the earlier dates (2006 or 2008) appear more aligned with the company's narrative than 2014. The 2006 date provided by Tracxn, which also names the founder, may be the most specific, although the discrepancy warrants notation.

The company is headquartered in New York City 4, with additional offices reported in Australia and Asia 9, indicating a global operational footprint.

Sequentum's funding history includes a significant Seed round on December 11, 2017, from WorldQuant Ventures, although the amount raised was undisclosed.1 WorldQuant Ventures is the venture capital arm of WorldQuant, a global quantitative asset management firm, suggesting strong validation from the financial industry, a key client segment for alternative data providers. Sequentum also participated in the Dcode Accelerate program, which connects technology companies with federal government opportunities.17 Pitchbook records indicate a total funding amount of $500K, potentially related to the seed round or accelerator participation, though this figure seems low for an established enterprise software company and may not represent the full funding picture.19

The web data extraction market is highly competitive. Sequentum faces numerous competitors ranging from large automation platforms to specialized scraping tools. Sources list competitors such as Diffbot, Connotate (acquired), Kimono Labs (acqui-hired), Zyte, Airbyte, UiPath, Nexla, Fivetran, Montara, Keboola, Bright Data, Twirl, and Import.io.6 Tracxn ranked Sequentum 10th among 194 active competitors based on its scoring system.6 Sequentum differentiates itself through its focus on enterprise-grade features, compliance, reliability, and its end-to-end platform approach.7

Estimates of Sequentum's employee count vary across sources, potentially reflecting different time points or methodologies. Figures range from 24 15, 51-200 16, to 95 employees.9 The figure of 95, cited in a March 2024 company press release 9, is likely the most current estimate available from the provided materials and suggests considerable growth over earlier estimates.

### **C. Current Leadership Team**

Sequentum's leadership team, as listed on its official website 4, comprises individuals with founding history, deep technical expertise, and functional leadership roles:

- **Sarah McKenna:** Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
- **Soeren Mondrup:** Founder & Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Holds a Master of Electrical Engineering from Danmarks Tekniske Universitet and brings 25 years of technical leadership, including founding three startups.4
- **Casey O'Neill:** Executive Vice President (EVP) Engineering. Possesses nearly two decades of software development and data analytics experience. He previously founded Barreled and Altitude Development Group and has been instrumental in developing the Sequentum Cloud platform.4
- **Tony Jaensch:** Founder & President.4
- **Elizabeth Abrams:** Fractional Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).4
- **Sangeeta Mishra:** Director & General Manager.4
- **BC Wilson:** Head of Customer Success.4
- **Cindy Baumohl:** Principal Data Engineer.4

This team structure reflects a blend of continuity and evolution. The presence of founders Mondrup and Jaensch provides deep institutional knowledge and likely maintains the original vision. The appointments of McKenna as CEO and O'Neill as EVP Engineering signal a strong emphasis on strategic growth, product innovation (particularly cloud-based solutions), and market expansion. O'Neill's background in data analytics and prior startup experience complements McKenna's expertise in scaling technology ventures.

It is worth noting that one source, CB Insights, mentions Sequentum having 5 executives 14, which contrasts with the eight individuals listed above. This discrepancy could stem from outdated information in the third-party database or differing definitions of what constitutes an "executive" role within the company. The company's own website 4 provides the more detailed and likely current view of the senior leadership structure.
