# About Us

## Our Mission

At **0DeepResearch**, we believe meaningful connections start with genuine understanding. We're building a collaborative **knowledge commons** where thorough research on people, organizations, and ideas becomes a shared resource that doesn't disappear after a single use.

## The Vibe Briefing Concept

Born from professional necessity, the **Vibe Briefing** is our signature approach: a **10‑minute micro‑research sprint** that reveals who someone is, what they've achieved, and where your interests might align. This pre‑meeting ritual transforms networking from transactional exchanges to meaningful connections by:

* Creating immediate rapport through knowledge of shared interests
* Identifying potential collaboration opportunities before your first conversation
* Demonstrating genuine respect by acknowledging someone's journey and work
* Saving time by bypassing surface‑level introductions

Our founder developed the prompt that powers these briefings:

> "Research **\[PERSON'S FULL NAME]** and compile a concise public profile: basic bio, notable achievements, and—most importantly—a list of publicly documented associates, collaborators, and friends (any context, not limited to professional work), with brief notes and sources for each connection."

## Why We Built This Platform

Every day, professionals around the world conduct similar research, scraping the web for insights on potential collaborators, clients, and partners. Yet this valuable work vanishes after serving its immediate purpose.

**0DeepResearch** preserves and shares this collective intelligence, creating:

* A growing repository of deeply researched profiles
* Analyses of organizations, movements, and concepts
* Technical insights and methodological approaches

## Who We Serve

Our platform supports:

* Professionals seeking more meaningful business relationships
* Researchers looking for comprehensive starting points
* Networkers who value depth over breadth
* Anyone who believes relationships matter more than transactions

## How to Contribute

**0DeepResearch** is a collaborative effort. We welcome contributions of:

* Original research profiles on individuals, companies, or organizations
* Deep dives into movements, concepts, or phenomena
* Technical guides and methodologies for effective research

To contribute, contact us through our **GitHub repository**.

## Our Standards

While we value comprehensive research, we respect privacy boundaries. All content on **0DeepResearch**:

* Uses only publicly available information
* Focuses on professional achievements and public associations
* Avoids speculation and unverified claims
* Includes proper attribution and sources
