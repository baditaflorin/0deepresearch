# **A Comprehensive Guide to Claiming Compensation in the $95 Million Apple Siri (Lopez v. Apple) Settlement**

This guide provides detailed information for individuals who owned certain Apple devices since 2014 regarding the $95 million class action settlement in the *Lopez v. Apple* lawsuit. The lawsuit concerns allegations of unintended Siri activations leading to the recording of private conversations. The deadline to file a claim is July 2, 2025\.

## **I. Introduction to the Apple Siri (Lopez v. Apple) Settlement**

### **A. Overview of the Lawsuit and Settlement**

The *Lopez v. Apple* class action lawsuit addresses allegations that Apple's Siri voice assistant, integrated into a variety of its devices, improperly recorded users' private conversations due to unintended or "false" activations.1 Filed in a California federal court in 2021 by consumers including Fumiko Lopez, the lawsuit contended that Siri would activate and record conversations even when users did not intentionally use the "Hey Siri" wake phrase or perform a physical gesture to engage the assistant.1 Furthermore, it was alleged that these recordings were, at times, shared with third-party contractors or used for purposes such as targeted advertising.1

To resolve these claims, Apple Inc. has agreed to establish a settlement fund of $95 million.1 This fund is intended to provide monetary compensation to eligible Apple device owners who may have been affected by these unintended Siri activations. It is important to understand that such settlements are common in class action litigation. In this instance, Apple's payment of $95 million occurs alongside a denial of any wrongdoing. This structure allows the company to avoid the substantial costs and inherent uncertainties of a protracted legal battle without formally admitting to the conduct alleged in the lawsuit. For individuals potentially affected, the settlement shifts the focus from a complex legal fight over Apple's culpability to a more straightforward process of determining eligibility and submitting a claim for a share of the settlement funds.

### **B. Apple's Position**

Apple Inc. has consistently denied all allegations of wrongdoing presented in the *Lopez v. Apple* lawsuit. The company maintains that its actions were lawful and that it engaged in no improper conduct.2 According to statements related to the settlement, Apple agreed to the $95 million sum primarily to avoid the ongoing expenses and distractions of litigation.5 The company also indicated that the settlement addresses concerns related to third-party grading of Siri audio, a practice Apple states it had already modified in 2019\.5

Apple has emphasized its longstanding commitment to user privacy, asserting that Siri was engineered with privacy protections from its inception.5 The company states that Siri data has never been utilized to build marketing profiles, has not been sold to any third parties for any purpose, and that it continuously works to enhance Siri's privacy features.4

The historical context of this settlement is noteworthy. The lawsuit itself makes reference to a 2019 article from *The Guardian* newspaper, which reported on Apple's third-party contractors occasionally hearing confidential user information during their review of Siri audio snippets.7 Apple's own statements acknowledge addressing "third-party grading" practices in 2019\.5 The eligibility period for this settlement, however, commences on September 17, 2014, extending through December 31, 2024\.1 This lengthy period covers times both before and after the public discussions surrounding voice assistant data handling in 2019 and Apple's subsequent changes to its practices. This suggests the settlement aims to resolve a broad spectrum of concerns that arose during a period of evolving public awareness and technological development in voice assistant privacy.

### **C. Legitimacy of Settlement Communications**

Individuals who may be part of the settlement class might receive official communications regarding this lawsuit. It has been confirmed that emails originating from the address "info@lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com" and bearing subject lines such as "Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement" are legitimate notifications pertaining to this settlement.1 Recipients are advised to review these communications carefully, as they may contain important information, including unique codes for filing a claim.

## **II. Are You Eligible to Claim Compensation?**

Determining eligibility is the first crucial step for any potential claimant. The settlement has specific criteria that must be met.

### **A. Core Eligibility Requirements – A Checklist**

To be eligible for a payment from the settlement, an individual must meet all the following conditions:

1. **Device Ownership/Purchase Period:** The individual must have owned or purchased one or more qualifying Apple devices at any time between **September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024**.1 This extensive timeframe, spanning over a decade, means a substantial number of Apple users could potentially fall within this criterion.  
2. **Qualifying Siri-Enabled Apple Devices:** The settlement covers a wide array of Apple products that are equipped with the Siri voice assistant. The specific devices identified as "Siri Devices" in the settlement documents are listed below 8:

| Table 1: Eligible Siri-Enabled Apple Devices |
| :---- |
| iPhones |
| iPads |
| Apple Watches |
| MacBooks |
| iMacs |
| HomePods |
| iPod Touches |
| Apple TVs |

3. **Residency Requirement:** The individual must reside in the United States or its territories.8 This is a standard geographical limitation for U.S.-based class action settlements.  
4. **The "Unintended Siri Activation" Condition:** This is a key requirement. The individual must attest—declare as true—that they experienced at least one unintended activation of Siri on an eligible Apple device during a confidential or private communication within the class period (September 17, 2014, to December 31, 2024).1 This means Siri began listening or recording without an intentional trigger, such as saying "Hey Siri" or physically activating the assistant (e.g., pressing and holding the home button), and this occurred while the individual was engaged in a conversation they intended to be private.1  
   It is critical to understand that this attestation must be made **under penalty of perjury**.4 This is a formal legal declaration, and making a false statement could have serious consequences. Therefore, individuals must genuinely believe they have experienced such an unintended activation during a private conversation before submitting a claim.  
   While the range of eligible devices and the lengthy ownership period are broad, the actual trigger for a valid claim hinges on this specific type of incident. Mere ownership of an eligible device is not sufficient; the claimant must be able to truthfully attest to the experience of an unintended Siri activation during a private moment.  
   Importantly, claimants are required to attest to the unintended activation event itself occurring under private circumstances. The settlement as a whole addresses the broader allegations that such activations resulted in confidential communications being obtained by Apple and/or shared with third parties.8 The structure of a class action settlement means that individual claimants do not bear the burden of proving that their specific conversation was definitively recorded and subsequently misused by Apple. Such proof would be nearly impossible for an individual to obtain. The focus of the personal attestation is on the user's experience of the unintended activation event.  
5. **Siri Enabled on Device:** The individual must have enabled the Siri feature on the device(s) for which they are submitting a claim.8 This is a logical prerequisite, as the lawsuit pertains to the functionality of Siri.

### **B. Who is Excluded from the Settlement Class?**

Certain individuals and entities are explicitly excluded from participating in this settlement. These include: Apple Inc. itself; any entity in which Apple holds a controlling interest; Apple's directors, officers, and employees; Apple's legal representatives, successors, and assigns.8 Additionally, all judicial officers assigned to preside over this case, along with their staff and immediate families, are excluded.8

Furthermore, individuals who previously took formal steps to exclude themselves (opted out) from the Settlement Class during an earlier phase of the litigation are not eligible to receive a payment, unless they formally withdraw their request for exclusion by the specified deadline of July 2, 2025\.10

## **III. Step-by-Step Guide to Filing Your Claim**

Once eligibility is confirmed, the next step is to file a claim. This section outlines the procedures involved.

### **A. The Central Hub: Official Settlement Website**

All official information, including claim forms and updates, is centralized on the official settlement website: www.lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com.8 It is crucial to use this official portal for all claim-related activities to ensure the information is accurate and submissions are correctly processed.

### **B. Claim Submission Methods: Online or Mail**

Claimants have two options for submitting their Claim Form 10:

* **Online:** Claims can be submitted electronically through the official settlement website. The deadline for online submission is **11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on July 2, 2025**.10  
* **Mail:** A physical Claim Form can be completed and mailed to the Settlement Administrator. Mailed Claim Forms must be **postmarked on or before July 2, 2025**.10 The mailing address is: Lopez Voice Assistant Settlement Administrator P.O. Box 6609 614 Cranbury Rd East Brunswick, NJ 08816 10

### **C. Scenario A: You Received an Email or Postcard with a Claimant Identification Code and Confirmation Code**

Many individuals deemed potentially eligible may have received a direct notification via email or postcard from the Settlement Administrator.1 These notices typically contain a unique **Claimant Identification Code** and a **Confirmation Code**.

If such codes were received, they must be entered on the Claim Form, usually in a designated section (e.g., Section II of the downloadable PDF form).10 Using these codes often pre-fills some of the claimant's information and can simplify the submission process. After entering the codes and specifying the number of devices being claimed, claimants can generally proceed directly to the sections concerning payment selection and the required attestations.10

### **D. Scenario B: You Did NOT Receive Codes but Believe You Are Eligible**

It is still possible to file a claim even if no direct notification with codes was received, provided all eligibility criteria are met.3 On the official settlement website, there will typically be an option to start a "New Claim" or a similar designation for those without pre-assigned codes.3 If using a downloadable Claim Form, these individuals would proceed to complete all required sections, including those for personal and device purchase information (e.g., Section III).10 All necessary information will need to be provided manually.

### **E. Information and Documentation Required**

Whether filing with or without codes, certain information is necessary to complete the Claim Form:

1. **Personal Contact Information** (Typically Section I of the Claim Form 10):  
   * Full Name  
   * Current Mailing Address (Street, City, State, Zip Code)  
   * Email Address  
   * A phone number may also be requested, particularly for those filing a new claim without codes.4  
2. **Device Information** (Primarily for those filing without codes, e.g., Section III of Claim Form 10):  
   * Claims can be submitted for **up to five (5) Siri-enabled devices**.1  
   * For each device claimed, if not using pre-filled codes, the following is required:  
     * The **email address associated with the Siri Device(s)**.10 This is a significant detail. Apple devices are commonly linked to an Apple ID, which is an email address used for various services. This email likely serves as an additional verification point for the Settlement Administrator, potentially for cross-referencing with records related to Apple ID usage or device registration. Claimants should ensure this email is accurate for the relevant period of device ownership.  
     * And **either**:  
       * **Proof of purchase** (e.g., a sales receipt or invoice) for the device.3  
       * **OR**, if proof of purchase is unavailable, the **serial number and model name** of the device.10 The option to provide a serial number instead of a formal proof of purchase is a practical accommodation.10 Given the long eligibility period (up to ten years), many individuals may not have retained original purchase documents. Serial numbers are often more accessible, being physically on the device, within its software settings, or sometimes linked to an individual's Apple account. This flexibility makes the claim process more feasible for a wider range of eligible individuals who may not have meticulous records.  
3. **Attestations** (Typically Section V of the Claim Form 10):  
   * As previously mentioned, claimants must attest under penalty of perjury to several statements for each device claimed. These include affirming:  
     * Ownership or purchase of the Siri Device(s).  
     * Residency in the United States or its territories.  
     * That Siri was enabled on the device(s).  
     * That at least one unintended Siri activation was experienced.  
     * That the unintended activation occurred during a conversation intended to be confidential or private.  
     * Implicitly, this also connects to the class definition that alleges confidential communications were obtained by Apple and/or shared with third parties as a result of such unintended activations.8

It is imperative that all information provided on the Claim Form is accurate and complete. The Claim Form instructions explicitly warn that incomplete or false information, or failure to submit by the deadline, will result in the claim being rejected.10 The Settlement Administrator also reserves the right to request additional information to verify a claim. Diligence in completing the form and prompt responses to any queries from the administrator are essential to avoid jeopardizing a claim.

### **F. The Critical Claim Deadline: July 2, 2025**

This date is of paramount importance. **All Claim Forms, whether submitted online or by mail, must meet the July 2, 2025, deadline**.1

* For online submissions: By 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on July 2, 2025\.  
* For mailed submissions: Postmarked on or before July 2, 2025\. This deadline is absolute and will be strictly enforced.

## **IV. Understanding Your Potential Compensation**

While the settlement establishes a $95 million fund, it's important for claimants to have realistic expectations about individual payout amounts.

### **A. Payout Structure: Per Device Cap**

The settlement terms stipulate that eligible claimants may receive a payment for each qualifying Siri-enabled device for which a valid claim is submitted. There is a **cap of $20 per device**.1

### **B. Maximum Claim per Individual**

An individual claimant can submit claims for **up to five (5) qualifying Siri-enabled devices**.3 Consequently, the maximum potential payout per individual claimant, before any pro rata adjustments, is **$100** (calculated as 5 devices x $20 per device).3

### **C. The "Pro Rata" Factor: A Crucial Caveat**

The $20 per device figure represents an upper limit, not a guaranteed payment amount. The actual payment per device will be a "pro rata portion of the Net Settlement Amount".8 This means the final payment amount per device may be less than $20 and will be determined by the total number of valid claims and approved devices submitted by all eligible class members.5 If the volume of approved claims is particularly high, individual payments could be significantly lower than the $20 cap.

The "Net Settlement Amount" is the $95 million gross fund after deductions for court-approved attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, costs of settlement administration, and service awards for the class representatives who initiated the lawsuit.8 Attorneys' fees can be up to 30% of the fund ($28.5 million), and litigation expenses up to $1.1 million, plus service awards.8 These deductions will reduce the total pool of money available for distribution to claimants, thereby influencing the final pro rata payout. Given the vast number of Apple device owners over the extensive eligibility period, it is plausible that the number of claims will necessitate a downward adjustment from the $20 per device cap. Claimants should therefore maintain realistic expectations; the payment might be a token amount rather than a substantial sum.

### **D. Payment Timeline: Patience is Key**

Payments will not be issued immediately upon filing a claim. Several legal and administrative steps must occur first.  
The Final Approval Hearing for the settlement is scheduled before the Court on August 1, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time.1  
Settlement payments will only be processed after the Court grants final approval to the settlement AND any potential appeals filed against the settlement are fully resolved.5 Appeals, if any, can introduce significant delays to the payment timeline.  
The settlement website advises claimants to be patient, stating, "If there is no appeal, your settlement benefit will be processed promptly".3 Realistically, the earliest that payments might be distributed would be later in 2025, but this could extend into 2026 or beyond if appeals occur.3 The journey from filing a claim to receiving any payment is inherently lengthy due to these necessary legal processes.

### **E. Payment Methods**

When submitting a Claim Form, claimants will typically be asked to select their preferred method for receiving payment, should their claim be approved.3 Common options include:

* **Physical Check:** Mailed to the address provided on the Claim Form.  
* **Electronic Check (E-check):** Sent digitally to the email address provided.  
* **Direct Deposit (ACH):** For those filing online, there may be an option to provide bank account details for a direct deposit.

## **V. Other Options and Important Considerations for Class Members**

Beyond filing a claim, individuals who fall within the definition of the Settlement Class have other legally mandated options. It is important to understand these alternatives, as the choice made can affect legal rights.

### **A. Excluding Yourself (Opting Out) from the Settlement**

**What it Means:** An individual can choose to exclude themselves, or "opt out," from the Settlement Class. If this option is chosen, the individual will **not** receive any monetary payment from this $95 million settlement. However, by opting out, they will retain any rights they may have to individually sue Apple (or be part of a different lawsuit) concerning the same legal issues and alleged conduct addressed in the *Lopez v. Apple* case.8 Conversely, if an individual does not opt out, they will be bound by the terms of the settlement (if approved by the Court) and will give up their right to sue Apple separately for these claims.

The decision to opt out is significant. It is typically considered by individuals who believe their specific damages from the alleged conduct are substantially greater than what the class settlement is likely to provide, and who are prepared to undertake the complexities, costs, and risks of individual litigation.

Procedure:  
To opt out, a written "Request for Exclusion" must be mailed to the Settlement Administrator.8 The request must be sent to:  
Lopez Voice Assistant Settlement Administrator  
Attn: Exclusions  
P.O. Box 6609  
614 Cranbury Rd  
East Brunswick, NJ 08816  
8  
The Request for Exclusion must include the individual's full name, current address, and telephone number; the case name and number (*Lopez et al. v. Apple Inc.*, Case No. 4:19-cv-04577 (N.D. Cal.)); information to verify class membership (such as the Claimant ID and Confirmation Code if received, or email addresses associated with their Siri Devices); their personal signature and the date; and a clear, unambiguous statement that they wish to "opt out" or be "excluded" from the Settlement Class.8

**Deadline for Opt-Out:** The Request for Exclusion must be **postmarked no later than July 2, 2025**.8

### **B. Objecting to the Settlement**

**What it Means:** A class member can express their disapproval of the settlement terms by filing an objection with the Court. Objecting allows an individual to explain to the Court why they believe the settlement (or parts of it, such as the amount of attorneys' fees requested) is unfair, inadequate, or unreasonable.8 It is important to note that an individual can object to the settlement and still be eligible to receive a payment if the settlement is ultimately approved by the Court. Objecting does not allow one to ask the Court for a larger settlement amount for oneself; rather, it is a formal way to voice concerns about the overall terms.8

The process for lodging a formal objection is detailed and requires specific information and adherence to procedural rules.8 A mere letter of complaint will likely not suffice as a formal objection that the Court will consider in depth. This structured approach ensures that objections are substantive and manageable for judicial review.

Procedure:  
A written objection must be filed with the Court. This can be done electronically via the Court's ECF (Electronic Case Filing) system (if the individual is an attorney or registered user), by mailing it, or by delivering it in person.8 If mailing, the objection should be sent to:  
Clerk of Court  
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California  
450 Golden Gate Avenue, Box 36060  
San...source 94102  
(Reference Case No. 4:19-cv-04577-JSW)  
8  
The objection must include: the objector's full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address; their signature (and their counsel's information, if represented); the case name and number; information sufficient to verify their membership in the Settlement Class; a detailed statement of each objection, including the grounds and any supporting evidence; whether the objection applies only to the objector, a subset of the class, or the entire class; a list of all other cases in which the objector or their counsel has filed an objection to a class action settlement in the past five years; and a statement indicating whether the objector or their counsel intends to speak at the Final Approval Hearing.8

Deadline for Objecting: The objection must be filed or postmarked by July 2, 2025.8  
Individuals who file a timely written objection also have the right to appear at the Final Approval Hearing (either in person or remotely, if permitted by the Court at that time) to voice their objection, but they must have submitted the written objection by the deadline to be heard.8

### **C. Doing Nothing**

**What it Means:** If an eligible class member does nothing—meaning they do not file a claim, do not opt out, and do not object—they will receive **no monetary payment** from the settlement. Furthermore, if the settlement is approved by the Court, they will still be **bound by its terms**. This means they will **give up their rights** to sue Apple separately for any of the legal claims that are resolved by this settlement.8

Class members face a critical decision point. Remaining passive (doing nothing) generally results in forfeiting both potential compensation from this settlement and the right to pursue individual claims later for the same issues. Active participation—whether by filing a claim, opting out, or objecting—is necessary to either benefit from the settlement or preserve individual legal options. For most eligible individuals who believe they were affected, doing nothing is often the least favorable outcome.

### **D. Attending the Final Approval Hearing**

Members of the Settlement Class have the right to attend the Final Approval Hearing. At this hearing, the Court will consider whether to grant final approval to the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate. The Court will also consider requests from Class Counsel for attorneys' fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses, as well as service awards for the Class Representatives.8

* **Date and Time:** August 1, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time.8  
* **Location:** United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Courthouse, 1301 Clay Street, Courtroom 5 – 2nd Floor, Oakland, CA 94612\.8 It is advisable to check the official settlement website for any updates or changes to the hearing date, time, or location, as these can sometimes be rescheduled by the Court.8

## **VI. Key Dates and Contact Information**

Staying informed about deadlines and knowing who to contact for questions are vital aspects of navigating this settlement.

### **A. Summary of Critical Deadlines**

The following table summarizes the key dates and deadlines associated with the *Lopez v. Apple* settlement. The convergence of several critical deadlines on July 2, 2025, necessitates that class members make their decisions and take appropriate action by this single date. These are concurrent deadlines; for example, one cannot wait to see the outcome of a claim before deciding to opt out.

### **C. Information on Class Counsel**

Class Counsel are the lawyers officially appointed by the Court to represent the collective interests of all members of the Settlement Class. Class members do not need to hire their own lawyer to participate in the settlement, as Class Counsel already represents them.8 However, any class member may choose to hire their own attorney at their own expense.

The Long Form Notice identifies Class Counsel as 8:

## **VII. Conclusion: Securing Your Potential Share**

The $95 million settlement in the *Lopez v. Apple* lawsuit presents an opportunity for eligible Apple users who owned specific Siri-enabled devices between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024, to claim compensation. A core requirement for eligibility is the attestation, under penalty of perjury, to experiencing at least one unintended Siri activation during a conversation intended to be private.

The most critical date for potential claimants is **July 2, 2025**. This is the absolute deadline for submitting a Claim Form (either online or postmarked by mail), for requesting exclusion from the settlement (opting out), and for filing any objections to the settlement terms.

Individuals who believe they may be eligible are strongly encouraged to visit the official settlement website, www.lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com. This website is the definitive source for the most current information, claim forms, and any updates regarding the settlement process.

It is also important to approach this process with an understanding that payments, if claims are approved, will not be immediate. The Final Approval Hearing is scheduled for August 1, 2025, and payments will only be distributed after court approval and the resolution of any potential appeals, which can take time. Patience will be necessary.

While individual payments resulting from this type of class action settlement may be modest, particularly after pro rata adjustments, participation by eligible individuals serves a broader purpose. Each valid claim contributes to the collective resolution of the privacy concerns raised in the lawsuit. This guide aims to provide the necessary information to empower consumers to navigate this legal process effectively and make informed decisions about their rights and options. An informed individual is better equipped to successfully file a valid claim if eligible, or to choose an alternative path that best suits their circumstances.
