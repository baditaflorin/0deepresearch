## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive public profile of Julian Qureshi, a Team Lead Sales at the German digital comparison company CHECK24, based in Munich. The analysis establishes that Mr. Qureshi is a long-tenured specialist in the field of *Arbeitskraftabsicherung* (occupational disability insurance), a complex and high-value segment of the German insurance market. His role is situated not within the general CHECK24 corporate body, but within a legally distinct and highly specialized subsidiary: **CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH**.

Mr. Qureshi's position is best characterized as a "player-coach." He holds direct responsibility for the professional and disciplinary leadership of a small team of sales advisors while simultaneously managing his own portfolio of customer consultations. The operational environment is defined by a modern, digital-first sales model that relies exclusively on high-quality, pre-qualified "warm leads" generated by the main CHECK24 comparison portal. This structure allows the team to focus entirely on consultative, needs-based selling without the need for traditional prospecting or field service.

His professional network is clearly defined within this specialized corporate structure. His direct senior management consists of the managing directors of his subsidiary, Dr. Florian Weber and Dr. Björn Zollenkop. Public records identify Stefan Höfner as a direct peer holding an identical role, and Markus Haugg as a specialist colleague within the same field of expertise. This evidence points to Mr. Qureshi being a seasoned middle manager who has built a successful career by achieving deep expertise within a key strategic vertical of one of Germany's most prominent InsurTech market leaders.

## **Introduction and Methodology**

### **Objective**

The objective of this report is to compile a concise, evidence-based public profile of Julian Qureshi. The analysis focuses on three core areas: his foundational biography, his notable professional achievements placed within their corporate context, and, most critically, a detailed and sourced account of his publicly documented professional network.

### **Methodology**

This report is the result of a comprehensive analysis of publicly available data, including professional networking profiles, corporate registration filings, company-issued press releases and job advertisements, and news articles pertaining to CHECK24 and the German insurance industry.1 All assertions, data points, and conclusions presented herein are strictly derived from the provided source material and are cited accordingly. The methodology emphasizes the synthesis of disparate data points to construct a holistic and nuanced understanding of the subject's professional standing.

### **Data Disambiguation**

Initial broad searches for the name "Qureshi" yielded information pertaining to individuals in the professional tennis circuit.1 This data has been rigorously identified as irrelevant and has been excluded from this analysis. The report focuses exclusively on the subject Julian Qureshi, an employee of CHECK24 located in Munich, Germany. This disciplined filtering ensures the accuracy and relevance of the findings.

### **Analytical Approach**

A central challenge in profiling an employee of a large, multifaceted company like CHECK24 is accurately situating them within the correct corporate context. A superficial analysis might stop at the publicly branded employer, "CHECK24 Vergleichsportal." However, a more rigorous approach, and the one adopted here, involves deconstructing the complex CHECK24 corporate structure. By examining corporate legal disclosures, such as the company's *Impressum* (legal notice), and cross-referencing them with professional profiles on platforms like XING, it becomes possible to identify the specific legal and operational entity for which the subject works.2 This process revealed that Mr. Qureshi is employed by

**CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH**, a distinct subsidiary. Recognizing this fact is the foundational step that enables an accurate mapping of his management chain, peer group, and specific business mandate, elevating the analysis from a generic overview to a precise corporate intelligence assessment.

## **Public Profile of Julian Qureshi**

### **Biographical Overview**

Based on publicly available professional information, the following biographical details have been established for Julian Qureshi:

* **Name:** Julian Qureshi.6  
* **Current Position:** Team Lead Sales, employed on a full-time basis \[User Query\].  
* **Employer:** CHECK24 Vergleichsportal \[User Query\].  
* **Tenure:** As of the date of the source profile, Mr. Qureshi has been with CHECK24 for 12 years and 11 months. This indicates a start date circa 2011 and marks him as a long-serving employee within the organization \[User Query\].  
* **Location:** Munich, Bavaria, Germany \[User Query\].

### **Area of Specialization: Arbeitskraftabsicherung**

Mr. Qureshi's role and expertise are explicitly focused on *Arbeitskraftabsicherung* \[User Query\]. This German term, which translates to "occupational disability insurance" or "income protection," is a cornerstone product within the broader category of *Vorsorgeversicherungen* (pension and provision insurance). This is a particularly complex and significant area of the German insurance market. Unlike simpler insurance products, *Arbeitskraftabsicherung* involves detailed underwriting processes, including comprehensive health questionnaires (*Gesundheitsfragen*) and risk assessments, and represents a long-term financial commitment from the customer.7

The fact that Mr. Qureshi has specialized in this vertical for a significant portion of his long tenure at CHECK24 suggests a deep and cultivated expertise. This specialization is highly valued, as evidenced by CHECK24's dedicated recruitment for specialists in this field, who are expected to provide needs-based, in-depth online consultations.7

### **Notable Achievements (Inferred and Contextualized)**

While specific project-based achievements are not publicly documented, Mr. Qureshi's career trajectory within CHECK24 allows for the inference of significant professional accomplishments.

* **Long-Term Tenure and Promotion to Leadership:** In a fast-paced digital company known for its "startup flair," a tenure of over a decade is a notable achievement in itself.9 Rising to the position of "Team Lead" within this environment implies consistent high performance, adaptability to evolving digital processes, and a deep understanding of the company's culture and objectives. The career paths of colleagues provide a clear precedent for this type of internal advancement. For instance, Stefan Höfner, a direct peer, progressed from Senior Customer Consultant to Team Lead Sales.10 Another employee profile highlights that CHECK24 offers opportunities for management careers to high-performing staff, with one individual being promoted to Team Lead after just one year at the company.11 Mr. Qureshi's promotion is therefore a clear indicator of his value and success within the organization.  
* **Leadership in a High-Value, Strategic Division:** Leading a sales team within the *Vorsorgeversicherungen* division places Mr. Qureshi in a position of significant responsibility. This product area is not peripheral; it is a core strategic vertical for CHECK24, important enough to warrant its own dedicated subsidiary, management team, and specialized recruitment efforts.2 His success is therefore directly tied to the financial performance and customer satisfaction of his team in a high-stakes, consultative sales environment that is central to CHECK24's insurance business. He is not a general sales manager but a specialist leader who has risen through the ranks to helm a team in one of the company's most technically demanding and lucrative insurance verticals.

## **The Professional Environment: Deconstructing CHECK24**

### **The CHECK24 Group: A Structured Conglomerate**

On the surface, CHECK24 projects the image of a unified, dynamic digital enterprise. It is Germany's largest comparison portal, serving over 20 million customers across more than 50 product categories.9 The company actively cultivates a "startup flair," emphasizing agile teams, flat hierarchies, and an informal "Duz-Kultur" (first-name basis) in its communications and recruitment materials.9

However, beneath this branding lies a highly structured and deliberately segmented corporate conglomerate. The parent holding company, **CHECK24 GmbH**, presides over a network of legally distinct subsidiaries, each dedicated to a specific product vertical.2 This structure is not accidental but a calculated corporate architecture. By creating separate limited liability companies (

*GmbHs*) for key areas like automotive insurance, property insurance, and pension insurance, the group can foster deep specialization, tailor business processes to specific market needs, ring-fence liability, and create agile, accountable business units. This model allows each division to operate as a focused "company within a company," benefiting from the central brand's immense marketing power and lead-generation capabilities while maintaining its own operational focus and, presumably, its own profit and loss responsibility.

### **Pinpointing the Employer: CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH**

Analysis of corporate records and professional profiles confirms that Julian Qureshi's direct employer is not the parent company but the specific subsidiary responsible for his area of expertise: **CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH**.5

This entity has the following distinct characteristics:

* **Legal Status:** A registered German limited liability company (*Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung*).16  
* **Commercial Register:** Filed with the district court of Munich under the registration number **HRB 234455**.2  
* **Registered Address:** Erika-Mann-Straße 62-66, 80636 Munich, Germany. This address is shared with the parent company's headquarters.2  
* **Management:** The subsidiary is led by its own appointed managing directors (*Geschäftsführer*), who are distinct from the leadership of other CHECK24 verticals.2  
* **Product Portfolio:** This specific GmbH is explicitly responsible for the comparison and brokerage of *Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung* (occupational disability insurance), *Risikolebensversicherung* (term life insurance), *Unfallversicherung* (accident insurance), and a range of state-subsidized and private pension products (*Riester-Rente, Basis-Rente, Flexible Privatrente*).2 This portfolio aligns perfectly with Julian Qureshi's stated specialization.

This structural clarity is essential for understanding Mr. Qureshi's professional context. He operates within a highly regulated insurance brokerage subsidiary, with his reporting lines and operational mandate defined by the leadership and strategy of this specific business unit.

## **The "Team Lead Sales" Role: A Deep Dive**

### **Core Responsibilities: The Player-Coach Model**

An examination of CHECK24's recruitment materials for roles identical or parallel to Mr. Qureshi's reveals that the "Team Lead Sales" position is structured as a "player-coach" model, blending direct team management with personal sales responsibilities.3

* **Team Leadership:** The role entails the "fachliche und disziplinarische Führung" (professional and disciplinary leadership) of a small, focused team, typically comprising 3 to 5 customer advisors.3 Key leadership activities include providing ongoing coaching, conducting performance analysis through methods like call reviews (  
  *Gesprächsanalysen*), and delivering structured feedback to foster the continuous development of each team member.3 This hands-on management style is consistent with descriptions from other team leads within the company, who also emphasize coaching and employee integration as core duties.11  
* **Personal Sales Performance:** Crucially, the Team Lead is not a purely administrative manager. The role requires them to simultaneously "betreut gleichzeitig Deine eigenen Kunden im telefonischen Vertrieb" (manage their own customers in telephone sales).3 This dual responsibility ensures that the team leader remains a subject matter expert, maintains a direct connection to the market and customer needs, and can lead their team by example through demonstrated sales success.

### **The Sales Process: Consultative, Digital, and Lead-Driven**

The sales process for Mr. Qureshi's team is a direct reflection of CHECK24's overarching business model and is fundamentally different from traditional insurance sales.

* **Exclusively Warm Leads:** The most significant feature of the role is the complete absence of prospecting. The model operates with "keine Kaltakquise, kein Außendienst" (no cold acquisition, no field service).3 All customer interactions are initiated by the customer themselves through the main comparison portal. These inquiries are considered "100% warmen Leads" and are automatically funneled into a proprietary CRM system for the sales team to handle.19  
* **Digital-First Engagement:** The entire consultation and sales process is "komplett digital".19 Advisors engage with customers using a suite of modern tools, including "Desktop-Sharing, Videoberatung und weiteren innovativen Ansätzen" (desktop sharing, video consulting, and other innovative approaches).7 The process is further supported by intelligent workflows and AI-assisted services.19  
* **Consultative Mandate:** Given the complexity of *Vorsorge* products, the sales approach is strictly consultative. The primary task is "Bedarfsorientierte Online-Beratung" (needs-based online consulting) with the explicit goal of finding the "beste Lösung" (best solution) for the customer's individual circumstances.7 This involves guiding the customer through the entire process, from initial contact to contract completion, including assistance with complex application forms and health questionnaires.7

### **Performance, Compensation, and Culture**

The work environment is designed to be high-performance and high-reward, supported by a distinct corporate culture.

* **Compensation Structure:** The role offers "Exzellente Verdienstmöglichkeiten" (excellent earning opportunities).7 One job advertisement for a team lead in the same division specifies that with good performance, the average annual income is €80,000, while top performers can achieve €100,000 or more, as the commission potential is unlimited.7  
* **The "CHECKito Spirit":** The company promotes a relaxed and informal work culture. This includes a "Duz-Kultur" (first-name basis), no formal dress code, regular team events and "drink-outs," and office amenities like a "Game Area".7 This is balanced with a comprehensive package of employee benefits, including free office lunches, generous support for a company pension, a subsidized EGYM Wellpass for fitness, and attractive vouchers for other CHECK24 products.7  
* **Hybrid Work Model:** CHECK24 has institutionalized a structured hybrid work week. Employees are expected to be in the office for collaborative work from Monday to Thursday, with the option for remote work on Fridays.7 This model aims to balance the benefits of in-person teamwork with modern flexibility.

## **Publicly Documented Professional Network of Julian Qureshi**

The following table outlines the publicly documented professional network of Julian Qureshi, constructed from an analysis of corporate records, professional profiles, and company publications. The network is primarily situated within his direct operational sphere at **CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH** and includes the top-level leadership of the parent CHECK24 group.

| Name | Title and Company | Nature of Association with Julian Qureshi | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Dr. Florian Weber** | Geschäftsführer (Managing Director), CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH | **Direct Senior Management.** As one of two managing directors of the legal entity that employs Mr. Qureshi, Dr. Weber is part of the ultimate leadership of his specific division. | 2 |
| **Dr. Björn Zollenkop** | Geschäftsführer (Managing Director), CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH | **Direct Senior Management.** As the second managing director of the legal entity, Dr. Zollenkop shares ultimate leadership responsibility for Mr. Qureshi's division. | 2 |
| **Stefan Höfner** | Team Lead Sales Kundenberatung Vorsorgeversicherungen, CHECK24 Vergleichsportal | **Direct Peer.** Mr. Höfner holds a role identical to Mr. Qureshi's within the same specialized division and city (Munich), making him a direct professional counterpart. | 10 |
| **Markus Haugg** | Experte Arbeitskraftabsicherung (Expert for Occupational Disability Insurance), CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH | **Colleague / Potential Team Member.** Mr. Haugg works as a specialist in Mr. Qureshi's exact field of expertise within the same company and city. He is likely a senior advisor on Mr. Qureshi's team or a parallel team. | 5 |
| **Jan Schauhuber** | Former Geschäftsführer (Managing Director), CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH | **Former Senior Management.** Previously held a leadership role in the same division. His appearance in a 2019 press release for a charity event on behalf of the company indicates the division's public-facing activities. | 22 |
| **Dr. Henrich Blase** | Co-Founder & Geschäftsführer (Managing Director), CHECK24 GmbH (Parent Company) | **Group-Level Leadership.** As a co-founder and managing director of the parent holding company, Dr. Blase is part of the top-tier leadership responsible for the overall strategy and direction of the entire CHECK24 group. | 2 |
| **Eckhard Juls** | Co-Founder & Geschäftsführer (Managing Director), CHECK24 GmbH (Parent Company) | **Group-Level Leadership.** As a co-founder and managing director of the parent holding company, Mr. Juls shares ultimate responsibility for the leadership of the entire CHECK24 group. | 2 |

This network map illustrates a clearly defined organizational hierarchy. Mr. Qureshi's operational world is centered within his subsidiary, with his direct reporting line flowing to the managing directors of that specific GmbH, Dr. Weber and Dr. Zollenkop, rather than to the general management of the parent company. His peer group (e.g., Stefan Höfner) and specialist colleagues (e.g., Markus Haugg) are similarly focused on the same niche insurance products. This structure fosters an environment that values and cultivates deep vertical expertise, allowing specialists to thrive and advance within their chosen field. The parent company's leadership sets the overarching strategy and provides the powerful brand and lead-generation platform, but the day-to-day business of selling complex pension and disability insurance is executed by the dedicated experts within the specialized subsidiary.

## **Concluding Analysis**

The public profile of Julian Qureshi is that of a seasoned and specialized sales leader who has built a long and successful career within the dynamic German InsurTech landscape. He represents a key archetype of the modern digital insurance professional: an expert who thrives not through traditional field sales, but within a highly structured, digitally-enabled, and supportive corporate ecosystem.

His role and achievements are inextricably linked to CHECK24's sophisticated dual strategy. The company leverages its massive, centralized comparison platform to generate a constant stream of high-intent customer leads, which it then channels to decentralized, highly specialized business units. This allows individuals like Mr. Qureshi and his team to bypass the challenges of customer acquisition and focus entirely on high-quality, consultative selling in a complex product area where deep expertise is paramount.

Ultimately, Julian Qureshi's public profile is that of a stable, high-performing middle manager who has become a leader by mastering a specific, valuable craft. His professional network, though seemingly contained within his division, is a microcosm of CHECK24's broader strategic success. The company has built a dominant market position by cultivating deep expertise within focused verticals. Therefore, any professional engagement with Mr. Qureshi or his team would necessitate an understanding not just of the powerful CHECK24 brand, but of the specific operational realities, leadership, and strategic mandate of the **CHECK24 Vergleichsportal für Vorsorgeversicherungen GmbH**.
